  custom:
    - The tag "Gloomhaven Custom Content" is deprecated now and it's handling will be removed in the next version.
      Instead use the new tag "Content Box" now.
      The content in the bag functions the same, but the bag itself has some additional requirements (checkout the [documentation](https://gloomhaven-tts-enhanced.github.io/public-scripts/custom/latest/contentbox.html#metadata).)
    - Adding a content box into the game will now override most content if there's already one with the same name instead of raising a warning.
