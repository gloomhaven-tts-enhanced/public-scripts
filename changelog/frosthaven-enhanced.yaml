- version: 2.4.0
  release:
  change:
    - "Some bags with multiple objects inside are now considered infinite.
      Dragging an object out of them immediately places a copy back into them.
      It also prevents adding new objects there manually.
      Removing the tag 'Infinite' from them allows adding objects again.
      Adding the tag 'Infinite' adds this behavior to any container in the mod.
      Currently those bags are considered infinite:
      - The overlay tiles
      - The rulebooks and guides
      "

    - Dropping an overlay terrain tile onto a figure will move the tile below the figure.
      This includes things like Deathwalkers Shadows.
    - You can lock entries from the scenario flowchart again.
      Right-click on the scenario completion checkmark to hide the scenario again.
      This will also remove the scenario sticker from the map.

    - "Building 24: ||Planted herbs can now be tracked on the garden building card.
      Click the plots to select the herb to plan.

      Also see migration information part.

      It will be counted as 3 coins at the end of the scenario.

    - Loading a saved scenario or reloading a monster figure doesn't result in duplicate monster numbers anymore.
    - Defense can be set to a negative number using the campaign sheet.

    - The random item loot card isn't added to the loot deck if it was already was looted in a previous scenario attempt.

    - "Item 214: ||Fixes it's name to 'Cup of Ventillion'.||"
    - "Scenario 6: ||Map tiles use the correct side.||"
    - "Scenario 10: ||The Ice Pillars in the second room of the correct HP and the map tile is 16-A instead of 16-B.||"
    - "Scenario 15: ||Chaos Lieutenant shows immunities.||"
    - "Scenario 27: ||Altars are set up correctly based on character count.||"

    - "Building 81: ||If the bottom card of your current trial deck is 'Trial of Weakness', the whole deck will get reverted to match the intended order.||"
    - Check the town guard deck for the correct cards (the ones with special symbols on them).
      Loading a previous campaign doesn't know which card was unlocked so it just tries to guess and load the correct card.
      Change the cards to the intended ones if there are mistakes.
      The cards are now saved correctly.
    - Sticker G is removed when loading the campaign.
      You have reapply it, which you can now with the correct color.

      So when migrating from 2.3.0 (where the wrong name is given to the cards) make sure you check for the correct name on the object instead of the one on the image.||"
