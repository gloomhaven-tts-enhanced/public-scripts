= Extensions

Extensions are a mechanism to hook into different gameplay relevant parts of the mod.
Whenever a relevant gameplay event happens, all registered extensions are informed about that event so that they can handle it accordingly.
This is similar to how TTS works in general with their event mechanism, e.g. like `onLoad`, `onPlayerAction`, `onObjectEnterContainer`, etc.

E.g. when a player clicks on the level checkmark on their character sheet, an `onCharacterLevelChange` event is created.
This event is propagated to all extensions that registered for this event.

== Usage

In order to use the extension mechanism, the `ExtensionApi` must be used by the object script that handles the incoming extension calls.

[source,lua]
----
include::example$character.lua[tags=levelChange]
----

This registered all extension points that are defined on the object.
Extension points are globally defined functions on the object, just like regular TTS event functions.

== Available extension points

Extension points are grouped into different extensions.
