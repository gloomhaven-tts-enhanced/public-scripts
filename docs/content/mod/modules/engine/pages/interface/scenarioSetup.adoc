Be sure to review xref:campaign:start.adoc[Starting a Scenario] for any pre-scenario steps.

Here you will find a list of all available scenarios. Click "Refresh Scenario List" to get an updated list.
Be sure to check the boxes for "Show Locked" or "Show Completed" if you'd like to access any scenarios outside of the campaign.

When the scenario is complete, return to this menu and select btn:[Scenario Won] or btn:[Scenario Lost] to execute the post-scenario scripting.
All characters will return to full HP and XP will be tallied. Bonus XP will be added if btn:[Scenario Won] was selected.

Please check out xref:scenario:looting.adoc[Looting] for post-scenario loot bookkeeping required in the current mod version.

Once all loot is tallied, be sure to account for all post-scenario rewards or section links.
Once this is all complete, click btn:[Delete Map] and begin an Outpost Phase.
