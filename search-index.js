Figures/CharacterMini.ttslua info = { hpColour = \"#5080C1\", hpTextColour = \"#B70F0F\", startingHealth = 10, } FrameOffset = 230 require(\"Figures.CharacterMini\") The value for hpColour is the background color of the HP bar over the figure. Similar hpTextColour is the color of the text appearing on the HP bar. This is optional and defaults to black. startingHealth is the HP value for the character on level 1. The FrameOffset is the position where the HP bar will appear relative to the figure. The correct value can be found by experimenting a bit and see what looks good. Example 1.

No other values need to be set. Figures/CharacterMini.xml Name Character Sheet Use the Character Sheet Creator to generate the required script for the character sheet. Name Name of the ability followed by its initiative value Description Full name of the class. The initiative value of a card has to be a two-digit number enclosed by parentheses (e.g. Perverse Edge (08)). When an ability has multiple initiative values (like the Blinkblade from Frosthaven), multiple parentheses can be used. The initiative tracker then shows all of them and users can remove them if needed. Within the class box the ability cards then need to be placed into a deck. The deck needs to be named Starting Abilities for abilities that are unlocked by the class at level 1. All those cards will be put the players' hand when a new character is created. All other ability cards need to be in a deck named Advanced Abilities. This ensures that the Campaign Manager can correctly find them. Abilities only need a script, when it’s an ability that can spawn Summons. The script adds a button to the card that can be clicked and creates the Summon figure. The Summon also needs to be registered accordingly.

The second parameter is the position of the button that will appear. SummonCard.Position contains the default values for Gloomhaven and Frosthaven abilities and items you can use: GHTop, GHBottom, FHTop, FHBottom and Item. The third parameter is a thumbnail image for the summon to be used in the Context Menu. Name Unique name across all Summons. Tags Required tags will be set automatically through the script. Summons need to be inside an Custom Content Box to be registered correctly. Add this script to a Summons' figure script and adjust the shown values to your need. Figures/Summon.ttslua stats = { health = 2, move = 3, attack = 0, range = 0, attributes = {} } info = { hpColour = \"#AD735C\" } FrameOffset = 230 require(\"Figures.Summon\") The stats table describes the base stats for the Summon. The values should be self-explanatory. The attributes table describes the default attributes the summon has (like flying, shield or infusing an element). The format is the same as for Enemy Stats. The info table and the FrameOffset use the same format as the one for the class Figure. Add this script to the figure’s UI script. No other values need to be set.

This function takes two parameters: * The NAME of the object * The TARGET area within the player zone where the object should be placed * Valid values for TARGET are \"Hand\", \"HandTwo\", \"CharacterMat\", and \"CharacterSheet\" * You can specify a specific position relative to their target To easily get the position in the local coordinate system you can place the object where you want it and then paste that into the chat window: How to find a relative position value --Replace \"targetObjectGUID\" with the GUID where you want to place your object (e.g. the Player Mat) and \"objectGUID\" with the GUID of the extra object /execute print(logString(getObjectFromGUID(\"targetObjectGUID\").positionToLocal(getObjectFromGUID(\"objectGUID\").getPosition()))) An example looks as follows: Extra class content extra = { { name = \"Special Rules\", target = \"CharacterSheet\", }, { name = \"Special Overlay Tokens\", target = { PlayerMat = { 1, 0, 1 }} }, }, Registration of the class is done via the ClassApi.registerClass function.

Also, Condition immunities can be shared. E.g. you can define that a figure is always immune to this new condition when it also has immunity to \"Stun\". When a figure with a \"Stun\" immunity spawns, the immunity image for this new condition is applied as well. This can be done by providing an immunity attribute. local ConditionApi = require(\"api.ConditionApi\") ConditionApi.registerCondition(\"My Condition\", { image = \"http://...\", max = 5, immunity = { -- The image for the immunity image = \"http://...\", -- A list of other conditions or effects -- When the figure is immune to one of those, it will also be immune to \"My Condition\" sharedWith = { \"Stun\", \"Pull\" } } }) Effects are any special effects that a figure has. They can be registered so that an image (or text) can be shown below the figure’s HP bar. When an Effect’s name is then added to its Stats, it will show the registered image (or text). Effects can also be used to add additional images for movement types, or area of effects. Registering an Effect is similar to a condition. In fact, every Condition is also an Effect (so you don’t have to register it twice). The registration is done via the registerEffect function in the ConditionApi. The attributes are similar to registering a Condition. A difference is that the name is part of the table and not the first parameter to the function call. Also, Effects currently don’t use the max attribute. Either an image or a text has to be supplied. If the image is supplied, it will be shown when the Effect is active.

The table below lists the supported object types, as well as the required tags for them. Additionally, each content box needs to have a simple script attached to it, which describes some metadata for the content. The mod uses this metadata to determine if the content is compatible with the current version or check for updates for the content. The content box needs to have (at least) the following script attached in order to work with the mod. The script defines a function named getMetadata which returns a table with the basic metadata of the content. function getMetadata() return { -- The version of the content version = \"1.0.0\", -- The author of the content.

Any object that has one of those tags together with the Locked Content tag is also ignored (except for scenarios as stated above). Objects within nested bags are also checked and moved accordingly. E.g. a Summon figure inside a class envelope will also be considered. The objects won’t actually be removed from the content box when this process happens. They are cloned and put into the correct places. If you have content that is automatically registered and content that isn’t, you might consider separating them into different bags inside the content box. This way it’s easier for users to see, what they still have to place manually and what is already done for them. If the Metadata contains a URL to the changelog of content, the mod will load it to check for the latest version of the content. If there’s a newer version of the content than the currently loaded one, the users will get an update notification (just like a regular mod update). The file MUST be a JSON file and have a specific format. If the format doesn’t match, the mod might raise errors during load. The JSON file contains a single list, where each entry in the list represents one version of the content (so it keeps on growing with each release). Each release entry has some metadata about the released version, like the release date, the version number and the actual changes. Below is an example file for a changelog. Another (real live) example is the changelog for the mod itself. [ { // The version of the content. Must follow semantic versioning (https://semver.org/) as the mod assumes this format. \"version\": \"1.2.0\", // Release date of the content. Must have the Format YYYY-MM-DD. // If empty, the mod ignores this entry. This is useful to expand the file while developing the content // without the mod showing up a notification. \"release\": \"\", // A list of changes with different keys (here add for added features). // See below for supported keys \"add\": [ \"This is the text that will show up in the notification window.\" ] }, // example of the latest released version { \"version\": \"1.1.0\", \"nickname\": \"My cool name\", \"release\": \"2024-09-12\", \"change\": [ \"The thing now works differently\" ], \"add\": [ \"A new thing was added.\", \"Another cool thing was added.\" ], // Another list of changes to describe fixes \"fix\": [ \"Fixed that thing\", ], \"migration\": [ \"Change the name of that thing before migrating.\" ] }, { \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"nickname\": \"Initial Release\", \"release\": \"\", } ] NOTE Be sure to NOT include any comments in the JSON like in the example above. Those are just for documentation purposes and parsing the JSON file will break if it contains any comments. Changes can be described in the list with different keys. Each key has a different role in grouping changes into certain categories. The following keys are supported: breaking List any breaking changes of the content. This means the users typically need to actively change something in order for the content to still function. E.g. this could mean the content now requires a new minimum version of the mod, so the user needs to migrate to that new mod version first, before continuing using the content. Following semantic versioning, a breaking change also means the major version needs to be increased for this version (e.g. going from 1.2.0 to 2.0.0). deprecate Describes features that shouldn’t be used anymore. A future version of the content will remove that feature so this gives users a heads-up. Typically, this also means there’s a new way or new feature that replaces the old one, and it should be described here. change A feature that changed compared to the previous version. add A feature that was added to this version. fix A bug that was fixed with this version. known A list of known bugs/behavior for this version. migration Additional information that is relevant for migrating the content to the new version.

It will not be shown to the players, so a regular bag is sufficient, no extra model is needed. The bag must contain the Enemy Bag, the Stats-Sheet and the Ability Deck in any order. The bag itself will never be placed on the table by the mod, so it shouldn’t contain scripts as those would never be executed. Its sole function is to group all objects belonging to a single enemy type. Name Full name of the enemy. Tags Enemy Envelope This is an infinite bag containing the Figure for the enemy. It will be placed on the monster mat and new enemies will be spawned from the bag. Name Full name of the enemy followed by \" Standee\", e.g. \"Bandit Archer Standee\" The Enemy Bag is currently the best place to register the enemy. This is typically done in two steps. First, the enemy’s ability deck has to be registered. This is done by calling EnemyApi.registerEnemyAbilityDeck. It takes the name of the ability deck and the list of abilities it includes. The abilities can have two attributes: An image with the link to the image for this ability card. This value isn’t used for 1.3 yet, so it can also be ignored. It will be used for future versions, e.g. to show the active ability card of an enemy in the initiative tracker. A spawn element, describing which object the ability can spawn (like traps or summoning other enemies). Documentation about the proper attributes for this element can be found here This part should be skipped, if the enemy uses an ability deck that is already registered in the game. This is the case for all decks from the Gloomhaven base game. Example 1. Registration for the \"Archer\" enemy ability deck api/GloomApi.ttslua local EnemyApi = require(\"api.EnemyApi\") local R = require(\"api.Resource\") EnemyApi.registerEnemyAbilityDeck(\"Archer\", { abilities = { [1] = { image = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/any2cards/gloomhaven/master/images/monster-ability-cards/archer/ma-ar-1.png\", }, -- abilities 2 till 6 would be here too [7] = { image = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/any2cards/gloomhaven/master/images/monster-ability-cards/archer/ma-ar-7.png\", spawn = { { element = { type = R.ElementType.Trap, name = \"Spike Trap\", damage = 3, }, } }, }, [8] = { image = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/any2cards/gloomhaven/master/images/monster-ability-cards/archer/ma-ar-8.png\", }, } } Once the ability deck is registered, the actual enemy type has to be registered, to connect the enemy to the ability deck. This is done by calling EnemyApi.registerEnemy. This function takes the name of the enemy type and two named parameters: icon is the link to an image for an icon of this enemy type. This is currently used in the Context Menu when the enemy can be summoned by other enemies. abilityDeck is the name of a previously registered ability deck. This tells the mod that this enemy uses the ability deck with this name. Example 2. Registration of the \"Bandit Archer\" enemy. api/GloomApi.ttslua local EnemyApi = require(\"api.EnemyApi\") EnemyApi.registerEnemy(\"Bandit Archer\", { icon = \"http://cloud-3.steamusercontent.com/ugc/1688272925075790807/F181B084F5CA91BC0E0F75C682C6993C4BCBDA43/\", abilityDeck = \"Archer\", }) If the enemy is a boss enemy, another API has to be used instead: EnemyApi.registerBossEnemy. Since all bosses use the same ability deck, this is where their abilities are defined (e.g. which elements they can spawn). The spawn element works the same as for registerEnemyAbilityDeck and details can be found here. api/GloomApi.ttslua local EnemyApi = require(\"api.EnemyApi\") local R = require(\"api.Resource\") EnemyApi.registerBossEnemy(\"Bandit Commander\", { icon = \"http://cloud-3.steamusercontent.com/ugc/1688272925075790870/264D1A7A6C93A37894B204DD6CDB555F11B8B5BD/\", spawn = { { element = { type = R.ElementType.Enemy, name = \"Living Bones\", }, }, }, }) Name Full name of the enemy type. Description Must be empty. Tags Enemy (will also be set by the script). Put the following Lua script on the Figure. The value for FrameOffset defines where the HP will be placed at. Adjust the value to fit the model. You can use this tool to easily try out different values. Figures/Monster.ttslua FrameOffset = 260 require(\"Figures.Monster\") Figures/Monster.xml Name Full name of the enemy followed by \" Stat Sheet\", e.g. \"Bandit Archer Stat Sheet\". Tags MonsterStatSheet Within the script of the Stats-Sheet, the stats for the different levels are defined as well as how many figures can be present for this enemy type. To define the maximum number of enemies, declare a variable named count. Put the following script on the Stats-Sheet and adjust the values accordingly. Example 3. Defining the maximum number of figures. StatSheet.ttslua count = 4 require(\"StatSheet\") The stats per level are declared using the variable named stats. This variable is a table of stat entries, one per level. You can use a numeric index, to more easily set the values per level. Example 4. General structure of the stats variable StatSheet.ttslua stats = { [0] = { -- Level 0 stats go here [1] = { -- Level 1 stats go here } -- etc. } require(\"StatSheet\") The entry for each level has an attribute named orientation and the attributes normal and elite. In the case of a boss enemy, the level has an attribute boss instead of normal and elite. The orientation attribute defines the rotation of the Stat-Sheets object that shows the stats for this level. This is used by the mod to figure out which level is currently set on the Stats-Sheet by checking the current orientation of the object with the entries defined here. StatSheet.ttslua stats = { [0] = { orientation = {0, 180, 0}, normal = { -- stats for the normal version go here }, elite = { -- stats for the elite version go here }, boss = { -- this is used by bosses instead of the above two } }, } require(\"StatSheet\") Within normal, elite or boss the actual stats have to be defined. Checkout Stats for the available attributes. Example 5. More complete example of the Stats-Sheet script. StatSheet.ttslua -- maximum number of standees for this enemy type count = 4; -- stats per level stats = { [0] = { -- this is the orientation the stat that shows the level orientation = {0, 180, 0}, -- stats for the normal version normal = { health = 8, move = 3, attack = 2, range = 0, attributes = {} }, -- stats for the elite version elite = { health = 13, move = 3, attack = 3, range = 0, attributes = {} } }, -- same for level 1 [1] = { orientation = {0, 90, 0}, normal = { health = 9, move = 3, attack = 2, range = 0, attributes = { \"Poison\" } }, elite = { health = 15, move = 3, attack = 3, range = 0, attributes = { \"Wound\" } } }, -- level 2 and 3 omitted [4] = { -- level 4 is the same, but now the back of the stat sheet is used, -- so the rotation on the z-axis has to be changed to account for that orientation = {0, 180, 180}, normal = { health = 16, move = 3, attack = 4, range = 0, attributes = { \"Poison\" } }, elite = { health = 24, move = 4, attack = 4, range = 0, attributes = { \"Poison\", \"Wound\" } } }, -- and so on until level 7 } require(\"StatSheet\"); The Ability Deck contains the different Ability Cards. Name Name of the Ability Deck (e.g. \"Archer\"). Each Ability Card within the Ability Deck needs to have a special naming structure and the Monster Ability Card tag. Name Name of the Ability Deck (e.g. \"Archer\"). Description Definition of the initiative (see below). The description field is used to encode the initiative values(s) and the action(s) the enemy takes. Each entry has to start with an initiative value followed by a colon and a space. The initiative value needs to have a leading zero if it’s below 10. After the colon, the textual description can be added. This is used in the initiative tracker to show what the enemy is doing. Multiple actions can be defined by using a semicolon. Those will show up as separate lines in the initiative tracker. 31: Move +0; Attack +0 For abilities that shuffle the ability cards, add shuffle after the initiative. 15 shuffle: Move +1; Attack +1 If the ability grants multiple actions at different initiatives, you can use new lines. Each line will add an entry to the initiative tracker. 03: Attack +0 11: Move +0 20: Attack +0 To use icons in the initiative tracker, you must change your player color to black and update the GM Note instead of the Description field. You can use the following text for icons: {e.Attack} {e.Move} {e.Heal} {e.Loot} {e.Shield} {e.Retaliate} {e.Range} {e.Target} {e.Damage} {e.Jump} {e.Fly} {e.Teleport} {e.Generate Fire} {e.Generate Ice} {e.Generate Air} {e.Generate Earth} {e.Generate Light} {e.Generate Dark} {e.Generate Any} {e.Consume Fire} {e.Consume Ice} {e.Consume Air} {e.Consume Earth} {e.Consume Light} {e.Consume Dark} {e.Consume Any} You can also include an icon for any custom registered effect or condition using {e.} or {c.} respectively. 03: {e.Attack}+0 11: {e.Move}+0 55: {c.Poison} You can add other custom conditions/effects, as long as they are already part of the Markazi Gloom Color font by Dimon-II. To add them, the registerCondition and registerEffect functions allow a new entry called renderedMarkup which takes any string. Whatever you put there will be shown in the preview whenever the markup for this Condition/Effect is used. There are already helper via the new UiApi where you only need to provide the glyph and color used for the condition. E.g. for a condition, all you need to do is to find the correct glyph in the font and insert it into the first parameter of UiApi.conditionText \\u{}. The color for the condition as hex value is the second parameter. Example 6. How to add Safeguard as a custom condition: local UiApi = require(\"api.UiApi\") ConditionApi.registerCondition(\"Safeguard\", { image = \"...\", immunity = { ... }, renderedMarkup = UiApi.conditionText(\"\\u{E09D}\", \"#5B9977\"), }) You can include an AoE \"Area\" which will display an AoE pattern in the initiative tracker. This can be designated using {area.} with specific syntax to create the intended pattern: s will create a grey \"self\" hex t will create a red \"enemy\" hex a will create a blue \"ally\" hex e will create a blank space with no hex _ will begin a new row, and every even row will be automatically indented by half a hex Example 7. Wind Demon’s ability with two areas: -- first row: empty hex and two target hexes -- second row: the self hex and a target hex {area.ett_st} -- second area {area.ett_stt_ett} Stats for enemies and summons have the following structure. local stats = { -- The maximum health values health = 8, -- The base move value move = 3, -- The base attack value attack = 2, -- The base range value range = 0, -- A list of extra effects like retaliate shield attributes = { }, -- A list of immunities immunities = { }, -- A text that will be shown below the healthbar -- This can be used for describing what a variable means, e.g. on a boss -- like, \"V is the number of ...\" text = \"\", } This attribute takes a single value. For Boss enemies, this can also be a string in the form of \"8xC\", which will calculate the value based on player count. A Formula is currently not supported. The move attribute can either be a simple value (a number or string like the above), or a table with the attributes value and type. The attribute value determines how the figure can move and the type determines the movement type (e.g. for flying enemies). The value for this field can be the name of any registered Effect, but generally should be \"Fly\", \"Jump\", or \"Teleport\". -- A flying enemy move = { value = 3, type = \"Fly\" } The attack attribute functions similarly. It can take a simple value or a table with the attributes value and area. The attribute value determines the attack value of the figure the area attribute is the name of an Effect. The image for this Effect will be shown next to the attack value. Its purpose is to show the attack area for this figure, but it could be used for any other effect as well. -- An enemy with a special attack area attack = { value = 3, area = \"Area X\" } The immunities field is a list of Effects this figure is immune to. immunities = { \"Poison\", \"Pull\", \"Curse\", \"Stun\" } The attributes field describes extra attributes for the enemy, like if it has a shield value, or retaliated damage or always applies a certain condition. It’s a list that can contain three kinds of different values: A simple string. This is the name of any registered Effect, e.g. \"Generate Air\", \"Muddle\" or \"Curse\" A name, value pair. The name is the name of any registered effect and the value is the value for this Effect, e.g. \"Shield = 2\" or \"Retaliate = 2\".

Tag Specific tag for the overlay type (see Overlay Type). If you want to also add a 3D representation for the overlay you have to add a new state for it (see the TTS knowledge base for more info). By convention, the first state is for the 2D token and the second state is for the 3D token. You can also have more than 2 states. In this case, when the overlay is placed a random state is determined for each overlay during load. E.g. in the mod, the tree overlay has 3 different 3D models and one will be chosen randomly for each tree overlay token placed in a scenario. There are two kinds of overlay scripts: Overlay and BasicOverlay. The difference between them is that the first one supports adding HP bars to the overlay whereas the second one only supports adding buttons for [Actions] (like the \"Open\" button for doors). Traps have their own script that has to be added. The script has to be added to all object states of the overlay token (possibly with different parameters). Within the script, two parameters have to be adjusted. The parameter for withFrameOffset is the height where an HP bar will appear. The parameter for withButtonPosition is the height where a button for [Actions] will appear. The correct position probably has to be found through testing.

The mod itself contains the information on how to use the builder to generate a scenario. However, the builder currently only supports a subset of features the scenario definition is able to provide. E.g. it can’t set HP values for overlays, named enemies or loot effects from treasure chests. To add those features to a scenario, you can edit the generated scenario definition from the Scenario Builder. This, this section contains the documentation about the structure of the scenario definition. When you want to add or change some features, you need to understand this structure and make those changes accordingly. In the Concrete use-cases section you can also find examples for specific use cases to give you an idea of where to start. This section is currently not well documented. A lot of features are missing…​ The scenario builder creates a token, that contains the scenario definition within its script. To adjust the scenario definition, the script has to be changed. The script on the tokens looks like this: ## -- some more lines above this one __bundle_register(\"__root\", function(require, _LOADED, __bundle_register, __bundle_modules) -- this is where the actual code lies local ScenarioApi = require(\"api.ScenarioApi\") function onLoad() -- when the token is placed on the table, the scenario will be added -- to the list of available scenarios -- the first parameter \"Custom Scenario\" here is a unique id across all -- scenarios. In the scenario setup this will be the prefix in the list, -- e.g. \"SoX1 - The Name of SoX1 Scenario\" ScenarioApi.registerScenario(\"Custom Scenario\", { -- this is the scenario definition from the scenario builder -- it can be adjusted to add new features }) return end end) __bundle_register(\"api.ScenarioApi\", function(require, _LOADED, __bundle_register, __bundle_modules) -- more stuff after this one as well, that must be untouched To change the scenario definition, change the content between {} in the function call to registerScenario. You should also change the scenario ID (the first parameter of the function call, e.g. Custom Scenario in the example above). This ID needs to be unique across all scenarios. The ID can also be used to quickly spawn the scenario without using the Game Setup menu. Enter >spawn-scenario into the chat window (e.g. >spawn-scenario Custom Scenario given the example above). This will delete everything in the scenario play area as well as all monsters and then spawn the new scenario after a short delay. While this is mainly used for developing purposes, there’s nothing stopping you from using it in your gaming sessions as well. Collapse the following example to get an overview of the overall scenario definition structure. The different parts are explained in more detail in the following sections. Example of all the general scenario definition structure { -- The name of the scenario name = \"Black Barrow\", -- Optional icon which shows to the left of the scenario name in the Game Setup menu, typically for Solo Scenarios icon = \"http://cloud-3.steamusercontent.com/ugc/111111111111111111/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA/\", -- The scenario book used by this scenario scenarioBook = { name = \"Gloomhaven\", page = 3, }, -- A list of scenario conclusion tiles that can be revealed, when the scenario is finished scenarioConclusions = { { image = \"http://cloud-3.steamusercontent.com/ugc/1752439086837779719/8C6A36C4FDB88BCB7B012F7121A2DB8E1876D0B3/\", scale = { 1.50, 1.00, 1.50 }, buttonLabel = \"Reveal Conclusion (36)\" }, }, -- Whether the overlays are placed on a horizontal or vertical grid gridType = ScenarioApi.GridType.Horizontal, -- Adjustments to monsters inside the scenario, e.g. a changed ability deck, -- another monster level or different stats monsters = { [\"Bandit Guard\"] = { all = { levelModifier = 1, } } }, -- Registered extra content that should be placed when the scenario loads. -- Used as a fallback to include all kind of crazyness extraContent = { { name = \"Extra Stuff\", position = { 0, 3, 0 }, } }, -- The list of doors connecting the different rooms doorTiles = { { name = \"Stone Door Horizontal\", tiles = { { rooms = { 2, 3 }, position = { x = -1.75, y = 1.82, z = 6.06 }, rotation = { x = 0, y = 180, z = 0 }, tokens = { \"1\" }, } } }, { name = \"Stone Door Vertical\", tiles = { -- } } }, -- The list of rooms in the scenario, each containing their overlays, monsters and map tiles rooms = { [1] = { -- The list of used map tiles mapTiles = { { tile = \"L1\", position = { x = 0.9, y = -3.77, z = -3.03 }, rotation = { x = 0, y = 180, z = 0 } } }, -- The list of scenario section tiles that will be placed for this room scenarioSections = { { image = \"http://cloud-3.steamusercontent.com/ugc/1752439086836487818/4256434230672E8FBFFA1CBE7C1A93984DF2EA95/\", position = { -28.44, 1.75, 21.98 }, scale = { 0.69, 1.00, 0.69 }, hidden = true, buttonLabel = \"Section 02\", }, }, -- The list of overlays that are start tiles startTiles = { name = \"Stone Corridor 1\", tiles = { { position = { x = -0.43, y = 1.93, z = -5.30 }, rotation = { x = 0, y = 0, z = 0 } }, } }, -- The list of placed monsters monsters = { { name = \"Bandit Guard\", tiles = { { numCharacters = { [2] = ScenarioApi.MonsterLevel.Elite, [3] = nil, [4] = nil }, position = { x = 0.87, y = 2.06, z = -1.51 }, }, } } }, -- The list of placed overlays overlayTiles = { { bag = ScenarioApi.OverlayType.Trap, type = { { name = \"Spike Trap\", tiles = { { position = { x = -0.43, y = 1.93, z = 6.81 }, rotation = { x = 0, y = 180, z = 0 }, }, } } } }, }, }, [2] = { -- another room } }, -- A list of all monster types that are included in this scenario (including summons) monsterList = { \"Bandit Archer\", \"Bandit Guard\", \"Living Bones\" } } The scenarioBook property defines which scenario book should be used for the scenario. It has a name property which must match the tag of a registered scenario book. The page property defines which page will be opened, inside the scenario book. This page will be offset by 1 as it assumes each scenario book has a front cover that is not included in the page numbering. E.g. if the scenario book is opened with a PDF viewer, the viewer would show page number 4, but the definition would include page number 3. If the scenario spawns two pages of the scenario book, the property pageCount can be set to 2. More than 2 pages are currently not supported and are probably never required anyway. scenarioBook = { -- The scenario book to use name = \"Gloomhaven\", -- The page that will be opened inside the book page = 3, -- If 2 pages should be shown, set this value as well pageCount = 2, } The sectionBook property defines which section book should be used for the scenario. It has a name property which must match the tag of a registered section book. The sections property defines which sections from the book are relevant for this scenario. The mod will use this information to figure out which pages it needs to spawn from the book. Each determined page will spawn as a separate book at a fixed position. Only the buttons for the defined sections will be active, all other sections in the book will simply be black without a button. local scenario = { sectionBook = { -- the tag on the section book object name = \"Gloomhaven\", -- The list of sections that should be used for this scenario -- Determines which buttons will be shown and which pages will spawn sections = { -- the id values is the value shown in the button { id = \"2A\" }, { id = \"2B\" }, { id = \"3A\" }, } } } It’s possible to define extra attributes, stats, immunities or their used ability deck for all monsters of a given type as part of the scenario definition. It is possible to distinguish between normal and elite monsters as well. The general structure looks like this: local scenario = { monsters = { -- the name of the monster as the key [\"Bandit Guard\"] = { all = { -- settings applied to all Bandit Guards }, normal = { -- settings additionally applied to all normal Bandit Guards }, elite = { -- settings additionally applied to all elite Bandit Guards } }, -- another monster [\"Bandit Archer\"] = { -- same structure as above } } -- rest of scenario definition } The settings from all are applied to all monsters that are spawned for this type. Settings in normal/elite then are additionally applied to monsters of the given difficulty. All entries follow the same structure and look like this: all = { -- The ability deck to use. If not used it will use the monsters default -- ability deck abilityDeck = \"Archer\", -- A modifier that should be applied to the current scenario level. -- This will make the monsters stronger/weaker. It can be a Formula. levelModifier = 1, -- The current HP value for the monster. If hpMax is not used, this is also -- the maximum HP value. -- It can be a Formula. Use the variable \"H\" or \"this\" to reference the -- default HP value for this monster. hp = { \"+\", \"H\", 3 }, -- The maximum HP value for the monster. -- It can be a Formula. Use the variable \"H\" or \"this\" to reference the -- default maximum HP value for this monster. hpMax = { \"+\", \"this\", 3 }, -- Adjusted stats for the monster stats = { -- Adjusted immunities immunities = { -- Immunities that will be added to the monster. add = { \"Stun\", \"Muddle\", \"Poison\" }, -- Immunities that will be removed from the monster. remove = { \"Curse\" }, }, attributes = { -- Attributes that will be added to the monster. If the monster already -- has the attribute, it will be overwritten with this definition. -- The format is the same as for general Stats. -- The values currently can not be Formula, only fixed values. add = { \"Muddle\", Pierce = 3, Retaliate = { value = 2, range = 2, }, }, -- Attributes that will be removed from the monster. remove = { \"Shield\", \"Wound\" }, }, -- The adjusted attack value. Can be a formula, where the variable \"this\" -- refers to the default attack value for this monster (at its current -- level). attack = { \"+\", \"this\", 1 }, range = { \"+\", \"this\", 1 }, -- The adjusted move value. Can be a formula, where the variable \"this\" -- refers to the default move value for this monster (at its current -- level). move = { type = \"Flying\", }, -- The text that will show below the monster. text = \"New Text\", } } The same structure can be applied to an individual monster as well, e.g. to overwrite the stats of a single monster of a given type. The following example demonstrates this: local scenario = { monsters = { [\"Bandit Guard\"] = { all = { stats = { immunities = { add = { \"Poison\" } }, } }, elite = { stats = { immunities = { add = { \"Wound\" } }, }, attributes = { add = { \"Muddle\" } }, } } }, rooms = { [1] = { monsters = { { name = \"Bandit Guard\", tiles = { { -- This Bandit Guard will get the Position immunity from all numCharacters = { [2] = Scenario.MonsterLevel.Normal }, }, { -- This Bandit Guard will get the Wound immunity from elite -- and the Muddle attack effect from elite. -- The immunity from all is overwritten by the immunities from -- elite numCharacters = { [2] = Scenario.MonsterLevel.Elite }, }, { -- This Bandit Guard will get the Muddle attack effect from elite -- and a Stun immunity from its own definition. -- The immunities from all and elite are overwritten by its own -- definition numCharacters = { [2] = Scenario.MonsterLevel.Elite }, stats = { immunities = { add = { \"Stun\" } }, }, }, } } } } } } While it is possible to define the used ability deck on all levels presented above, it’s only useful to use it within the definition of all. It’s not possible to have the same monster type with different ability decks, so the first monster that spawns defines the used ability deck for all monsters of that type. And if the \"Preload Enemies\" option is used to prepare all monsters in a scenario at its start, the settings for those prepared monsters are only defined by all (as those don’t have a difficulty setting). Similar to the Monsters option, you can spawn scenario-specific figures which perform the same action each round. This is commonly used for named allies or unique basic enemies. These figures require a standee model which can be based on any existing summon or enemy, or you can register a custom figure (objects with the \"Figure\" tag included within a \"Gloomhaven Custom Content\" bag). Figures figures = { [\"Mechanical Turret\"] = { --name of the Summon, Enemy, or registered Figure object to use as a standee basedOn = \"Ancient Artillery\", --possible base values are \"Normal\" (White), \"Elite\" (Yellow), \"Ally\" (Blue), \"Boss\" (Red) and \"Named\" (Purple) base = \"Normal\", stats = { health = 10, attributes = { add = { Shield = 1 }, }, immunities = { add = { \"Poison\" }, }, }, ability = { initiative = 50, ability = \"{e.Attack}3 {e.Range}4\", }, }, }, When placing a figure within a room, you can also exclude it from spawning with different player counts. Placed Figures figures = { [1] = { name = \"Mechanical Turret\", position = { x = '15.15', y = '1.76', z = '-8.75', }, rotation = { x = '0.00', y = '180.00', z = '0.00', }, characterCount = { [2] = R.Remove, [3] = R.Remove, }, }, }, You can define the conditions and names for overlays, commonly used for traps: Overlays overlays = { --This is the original overlay tile's name. [\"Bear Trap\"] = { --These are the trap conditions applied when triggered. conditions = { \"Damage\" }, --This is the new name given to all overlays of this type when spawned during scenario setup. name = \"Damage Trap\", }, }, You can add a Scenario Aid token to an object’s UI, or even include a health bar: Objectives overlayTiles = { { bag = R.ElementType.Obstacle, type = { { name = \"Rock Column\", tiles = { { position = { x = -1.31, y = 1.87, z = 9.85, }, rotation = { x = 0, y = 0, z = 0, }, name = \"Summoning Stone\", tokens = { \"a\" }, hp = {\"+\", \"C\", 1}, }, }, }, }, }, }, For a complete list of actions available, see Common > Actions: https://gloomhaven-tts-enhanced.github.io/public-scripts/custom/1.3/common/action.html. You can add a Treasure action to an object (typically a treasure chest) to spawn the card defined as treasure: Treasure action = { name = \"50\", treasure = \"Treasure 50\", }, You can set the chest as a scenario goal as well: Treasure (G) action = { treasure = \"G\", }, You can add an action to an objective to act as a door. Triggering this can be used to reveal hidden rooms or spawn additional enemies: Door/Rooms action = { rooms = { 6, 2 } } You may need to add tags to an overlay or standee when it’s spawned so that you can build actions to interact with it. A common use is to remove the object as part of an action. Adding tags to an object overlayTiles = { { bag = R.ElementType.Obstacle, type = { { name = \"Nest\", tiles = { { position = { x = 3.94, y = 1.86, z = 6.82, }, rotation = { x = 0, y = 0, z = 0, }, tags = {\"Scenario X Nest 1\"}, }, }, }, }, }, }, Some scenarios require placing some objects randomly during setup, e.g. placing objective tokens face down or spawning the content of a random dungeon card. To handle this, you need to define randomPools, and randomObjects within a room. Random pools are defined at the top level of the scenario. Give them a name, and the type shown below. In the values attributes, you can define the list of tokens you want to use. Adding a pool of random tokens randomPools = { { name = \"Some name\", type = ScenarioApi.RandomType.Tokens, values = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 }, } }, Then inside a room, you can add the new randomObjects property and add a list of things that can randomly be placed there. Use the property pool to reference the pool of random objects from above and the position where the object shall be placed. Define the locations where the random objects may be spawned rooms = { [1] = { randomObjects = { { -- one possible position for a token from Pool \"Some name\" pool = \"Some name\", position = { ... }, }, { -- another possible position for a token from Pool \"Some name\" pool = \"Some name\", position = { ... }, }, -- and so on } } }, As a fallback mechanism extra scenario components can be defined. This is meant to easily supply objects that are currently not supported through scripting (e.g. monsters that use different attack modifier decks). Those first have to be registered inside a Custom Content Box. Then inside the scenario definition, they can be referenced by their name and be placed at a specific position. It’s possible to define the extra components on the top level of the scenario and also in each room. When defined on the top level the components will spawn, once the scenario is loaded. Components defined on a room are loaded once the room is opened. Both entries are lists, so they can define multiple components. local scenario = { -- can be defined on the top level extraContent = { -- one entry { -- The name of the registered extra component name = \"Extra Stuff\", -- The position where the content will spawn position = { 10, 2, 10 }, }, -- a second entry { -- .. }, }, rooms = { [2] = { -- Or as part of a room extraContent = { { name = \"More Extra Stuff\", position = { 10, 2, 10 }, } } } } } The examples in this section create a local variable named scenario. This contains the relevant part of the scenario definition for the example and is the part that would be passed to registerScenario. Changes the ability deck monsters will use. -- The Bandit Guards use the Archer ability deck instead of their own Guard deck local scenario = { monsters = { [\"Bandit Guard\"] = { all = { abilityDeck = \"Archer\" } } } } Loads additional components as a fall-back that are currently not supported with scripting (also known as \"asshole bags\"). local scenario = { -- This will be placed together with the scenario extraContent = { { name = \"Extra Stuff\", position = { 10, 2, 10 }, } }, rooms = { [2] = { -- This will be placed, once the room 2 will be opened extraContent = { { name = \"More Extra Stuff\", position = { 10, 2, 10 }, } } } } }","title":"Scenarios","component":"custom","version":"2.3","name":"scenario","url":"/custom/latest/scenario.html","titles":[{"text":"Basics","hash":"_basics","id":1},{"text":"General scenario definition structure","hash":"_general_scenario_definition_structure","id":2},{"text":"Scenario books","hash":"_scenario_books","id":3},{"text":"Section Books","hash":"_section_books","id":4},{"text":"Default Monster Settings","hash":"_default_monster_settings","id":5},{"text":"Figures","hash":"_figures","id":6},{"text":"Overlays","hash":"_overlays","id":7},{"text":"Objectives","hash":"_objectives","id":8},{"text":"Actions","hash":"_actions","id":9},{"text":"Frequently used actions","hash":"_frequently_used_actions","id":10},{"text":"Tags","hash":"_tags","id":11},{"text":"Randomly placed objects","hash":"_randomly_placed_objects","id":12},{"text":"Extra content","hash":"_extra_content","id":13},{"text":"Concrete use-cases","hash":"_concrete_use_cases","id":14},{"text":"Custom monster ability decks","hash":"_custom_monster_ability_decks","id":15},{"text":"Extra content","hash":"_extra_content_2","id":16}]},"12":{"id":12,"text":"Most custom content requires some script, that is either added directly to the content or tells the mod about the content. Generally, you have two ways to work with the scripts. Either through an external tool (the VS Code text editor), or the scripting window inside TTS. The first method is the preferred way. While it requires a bit of setup, it’s a lot easier to continuously work on custom content with it. E.g. it will be a lot easier to update the scripts of the content to the latest version used by the mod without the need to copy and paste a lot of code and unpack deeply nested bags in TTS (heck you can do everything without TTS if you want, even releasing the custom content mod). The alternative is to use the TTS scripting window. For this, you need to download the latest script from the releases. After you download the scripts from the latest release, you’ll find two folders inside there: base and bundled. You’ll need the bundled folder to work with the TTS scripting window. Extract the required folder somewhere in your file system. Download and install Node.js. Download and install VS Code. Create a new directory for your custom content project, where you want to work on it. Download the package.json file and put that into the directory. Open VS Code and open the directory. This can be done by using the menu File Open Folder…​ or by dragging the directory onto the workspace in VS Code. Install the extension \"npm\" by clicking on the menu with four blocks on the left bar. Locate the save file you want to edit inside the TTS save directory (checkout the knowledge base to find the default locations for your system). It can either be a regular save or a saved object. Copy the name of the save file (e.g. TS_Save_1072 for regular saves or Artificier if you have a saved object with this name). Open the package.json file in your working directory. Change the two occurrences of , to the name of the save file. E.g. with the save file name TS_Save_1072, the section would look like this: After you installed the above-mentioned npm extension, you’ll have the following section in the explorer in VS Code It may be not at the top but below other sections. You can reorder sections by using drag 'n' drop. If the section doesn’t show up at all, right-click on the heading of any other section and enable it. Hover over the setup entry and click the Play button that shows up. Afterwards, do the same with the update entry. This will download the latest scripts for the Gloomhaven enhanced mod. This completes the (rather long) setup, and you’re good to go. :-) If you have multiple save files you are working on, it’s recommended to have different directories for all of them. This way you don’t have to edit the package.json around. To start working on the save file, press the Play button on the entry extract inside the npm section. This will basically copy the save file from your TTS save file location and split it into multiple files inside the Contents directory if your current working directory. E.g a (reduced) Artificier save file looks like this: The save file has one bag that contains all objects of the Artificer. The extract command will create a new directory for all objects inside that bag. The name of the directory will be the name of the object followed by its GUID. If the object itself is a bag or deck it will create more nested directories to replicate the nesting structure from TTS. For each object, multiple files are created inside their directory. A file named Data.json will contain all the data about the object, like its name, tags, etc.. The file named Script.ttslua contains the attached script. The big advantage here is that the script only contains the relevant parts. In the TTS script editor, you have the whole script which contains a lot of unrelated stuff and you have to find the correct place where to put the actual scripts. A file named UI.xml contains the XML UI attached to the object. The same logic as for the script applies, as it only contains a reduced view of the script (e.g. just some ). When you use the embed command from the npm section, the reverse thing will happen. The files from your current working directory will be put together and create a new save file which then will be copied back to your TTS save file folder. While doing so, all the scripts of all contained objects are automatically updated with the currently downloaded GHE scripts. E.g. many scripts have commands like require(\"Figures.CharacterMini\"). What this means is: Please include the code from the file \"Figures/CharacterMini.ttslua\" at this place, computer (the same for in case of XML files). And this is what embed does. It loads the downloaded scripts and embeds them in the correct places. So the advantage is, that you only need to edit the relevant scripts and all other parts are automatically updated for you. No need to unpack nested objects inside TTS and copy/paste the same scripts over and over. If there’s an update to the release scripts, you can use the update command from the npm section to download them. Then use embed again and all scripts are updated in the save file. NOTE While working with scripts from a beta version, make sure the following line is in your package.json, inside the devDependencies section. \"@gloomhaven-enhanced/api\": \"beta\", If you are later working with the released scripts replace beta with latest und use the update command. In addition to changing the scripts, you can also change the for all nested objects (e.g. changing its name or adding tags), by editing the Data.json of it. Be aware though that the actual name (the one you can edit in the TTS UI) is called \"Nickname\" in the file, not \"Name\". Changing \"Name\" will pretty much break the object. You can also add tags by adding and entry to the Tags property. If the data currently doesn’t have a Tags property, you can easily add one somewhere like this: { \"GUID\": \"975b2e\", \"Name\": \"Custom_Model_Infinite_Bag\", \"Nickname\": \"Tools\", \"Tags\": [ \"Tag1\", \"Tag2\" ], \"Description\": \"\" } When using the TTS scripting editor, you have to use the bundled version of the scripts. We developed the mod by splitting the scripts into different files which makes it a lot easier to maintain. However, TTS doesn’t understand that splitting and requires to have one script per object. So all files need to be bundled together into one file again for TTS to work. Normally, this would be done by the Atom plugin automatically. The scripts within the bundled folder are the result of such a bundling. The scripts then are rather big and also contain code to make the bundling work. They always look like this: -- Bundled by luabundle {\"version\":\"1.6.0\"} local __bundle_require, __bundle_loaded, __bundle_register, __bundle_modules = (function(superRequire) local loadingPlaceholder = {[{}] = true} -- .. -- lots more lines -- .. end)(require) __bundle_register(\"__root\", function(require, _LOADED, __bundle_register, __bundle_modules) -- This is the relevant part require(\"Figures/CharacterMini\") -- this line also has to be removed -- The required code goes here end) __bundle_register(\"Figures/CharacterMini\", function(require, _LOADED, __bundle_register, __bundle_modules) -- .. -- even more lines here -- .. end) When you integrate those scripts you need to look for the line bundle_register(\"root\", function(require, _LOADED, bundle_register, bundle_modules). Everything between this line and the first end) is the actual script for the object. The previous line is required for the bundling to work and the following lines are the previously split files that are now put together. You don’t need to touch those. Whenever this documentation mentions including a script onto your object, you first have to locate the correct bundled file. This is given as the title of the script example. Figures/CharacterMini.ttslua info = { hpColour = \"#5080C1\", hpTextColour = \"#B70F0F\", startingHealth = 10, } FrameOffset = 230 require(\"Figures.CharacterMini\") E.g. here it means you have to find the Figures/CharacterMini.ttslua script within the bundled folder. Open that script and find the previously mentioned bundle_register(\"root\") line. Copy the script of the documentation mentioned after this line and remove everything till the first end (excluding the end). With this example, the final script would look like this: -- Bundled by luabundle {\"version\":\"1.6.0\"} local __bundle_require, __bundle_loaded, __bundle_register, __bundle_modules = (function(superRequire) local loadingPlaceholder = {[{}] = true} -- .. -- lots more lines -- .. end)(require) __bundle_register(\"__root\", function(require, _LOADED, __bundle_register, __bundle_modules) info = { hpColour = \"#5080C1\", hpTextColour = \"#B70F0F\", startingHealth = 10, } FrameOffset = 230 require(\"Figures.CharacterMini\") end) __bundle_register(\"Figures/CharacterMini\", function(require, _LOADED, __bundle_register, __bundle_modules) -- .. -- even more lines here -- .. end) This is the script you then have to add to the object in the TTS scripting window and use the Save and Play button. The same logic applies for the UI scripts. If the example code doesn’t have a title it means there’s no bundled script available, and you have to include the script as it is provided in the example.","title":"Using the scripts","component":"custom","version":"2.3","name":"scripts","url":"/custom/latest/scripts.html","titles":[{"text":"Using VS Code","hash":"_using_vs_code","id":1},{"text":"Setup","hash":"_setup","id":2},{"text":"Usage","hash":"_usage","id":3},{"text":"Using the TTS script editor","hash":"_using_the_tts_script_editor","id":4}]},"13":{"id":13,"text":"TODO","title":"Libraries","component":"custom","version":"2.3","name":"index","url":"/custom/latest/library/index.html","titles":[]},"14":{"id":14,"text":"Table 1.

Lists all the sections that are relevant for this scenario. Currently, all sections have to be listed. However, in a future version this will probably be reworked as the information about sections is also present in other parts of the scenario definition (e.g. on doors). The loot table for a scenario is defined by the loot attribute. It defines how many cards of each type should be added to the loot deck. Each entry for a resource is lower case and follows the name of the resource/herb. If a random item can also be looted in the scenario, the attribute randomItem can be added with the value true. loot: { coins: 4, lumber: 4, metal: 4, hide: 4, arrowvine: 2, rockroot: 1, randomItem: true, }, The goal of the scenario can be defined using the goal attribute. Depending on the type of goal, different attributes are available. If the goal is to defeat all enemies in the scenario, the type attribute needs to be set to defeat-all. The section attribute defines the section that should be read once the goal is achieved. goal: { type: \"defeat-all\", section: \"9.1\", } If the goal is to defeat a specific enemy in the scenario, the type attribute needs to be set to defeat. The name attribute defines the name of the enemy that must be defeated. example pending If the goal is to escape the scenario, the type attribute needs to be set to escape. The section attribute defines the section that should be read once the goal is achieved. goal: { type: \"escape\", section: \"8.3\", } If the goal is to destroy one or more objectives in the scenario, the type attribute needs to be set to destroy. The marker attribute defines (pending). example pending If no specific type matches the goal, use the other type. goal: { type: \"other\", } This currently has no effect at all and also not complete. It’s already included for possible later features, like showing and tracking the current scenario goal or to add the correct sections to the section book. Scenario effects can be defined using the scenarioEffect attribute. Depending on the type of effect, different attributes are available. If the effect is to add -1 modifiers to the characters' attack modifier deck, the type attribute needs to be set to attack-modifier. The card attribute defines the type of modifier added, which would only be -1,curse, or bless (note: curse and bless are not yet supported). The amount attribute defines how many of that card type should be added. example pending If the effect is for the characters to suffer damage, the type attribute needs to be set to damage. The amount attribute defines how damage should be suffered. example pending If the effect is to add one or more conditions to the characters, the type attribute needs to be set to condition. The conditions string defines a list of each condition that should be added. example pending This currently has no effect at all and also not complete. It’s already included for possible later features, like automatically applying scenario effects unless the character has a perk to ignore them. Each monster that shows up in the scenario needs to be defined through the monsters attribute. This is a table from their name extra information for the monster. This information can be empty if there’s nothing special about the monster. The name doesn’t have to match the actual name of the monster and can possibly be anything. When monsters are placed in Rooms the names used there must match one of the monster names defined in this section. Whenever a named version of a monster exists, it must have the monster attribute to define the original type of that monster, and the name attribute to define the name that should be used on the figure. monsters: { \"Algox Archer\": {}, \"Algox Guard\": {}, \"Algox Priest\": { team: \"Ally\", }, \"Algox Scout\": {}, }, More details about how to define monsters can be found here. Each overlays that shows up in the scenario needs to be defined through the overlays attribute. This is a table from their name to their extra information. Each overlay at least needs to define their type which determines the outline color that will be used for the overlay. The name doesn’t have to match the actual name of the overlay object and can possibly be anything. When overlays are placed in Rooms the names used there must match one of the overlay names defined in this section. A specific overlay can include the unless attribute, which allows you to definte criteria in which the overlay will not be spawned when true. overlays: { \"Ice Sheet\": { type: \"objective\", object: \"Large Ice Corridor\", stats: { health: \"C * (L + 2)\", }, }, \"Snow Rock\": { type: \"obstacle\", }, }, More details about how to define overlays can be found here. Doors need to be defined with the doors attribute. This is a list of door objects that will be placed once their corresponding rooms have been opened. doors: [ { name: \"Snow Door\", rooms: [\"2\", \"3\"], section: \"27.1\", position: [3, 2], }, { name: \"Snow Door\", rooms: [\"1\", \"2\"], section: \"6.1\", position: [0, 8], }, ], name The name of the overlay object to use for the door. It can be any object and isn’t limited to an actual door. This doesn’t use any information from the Overlays section. rooms The list of rooms that this door opens. The rooms are listed with their index attribute. section The name of the section that should be read when this door is opened. position The position of the object on the Grid. A scenario consists of multiple rooms. Each room can spawn new maps, monster, overlays, loot etc. The rooms attribute is a list of those rooms and each room has the same attributes. Each room needs to have an index attribute which identifies the room. This can be any name. Doors open rooms by their index. rooms: [ { index: \"1\", }, ], Only the very first room in the list will be loaded first when the scenario is loaded. If the room contains map tiles, those can be defined with the map attribute. This is a list of map tiles and their position. map: [ { name: \"11-A\", position: [-4, 9], rotation: 0, }, ], Each map tile has the following properties: name The name of the map tile object. position The position of the map tile on the Grid. rotation The rotation of the map tile. A room without map tiles isn’t really a \"room\" but can be useful for scripting the scenario. E.g. scenario 4 has a \"dummy\" room as its starting room which only contains two overlays with buttons. Those buttons are used to represent the choice of introduction to read for this scenario. If there are start tiles inside the rooms, those can be defined with the startArea attribute. This is a list of coordinates on the Grid. startArea: [ [-6, 5], [-5, 6], [-6, 6], [-7, 7], [-7, 6], ], If there are monsters for this room, those can be defined with the monsters attribute. This is a list of monsters which will be spawned when this room is opened. monsters: [ { name: \"Algox Archer\", position: [0, 11], playerCount: { \"2\": \"normal\", \"3\": \"normal\", \"4\": \"elite\", }, }, ], Each monster has the following properties: name The name of the monster. This must match one of the defined monsters in the Monsters section. position The position of the monster on the Grid. playerCount Defines for which players the monster shows up and which difficulty it has. If a mapping for a player count is missing, the monster won’t show up. Otherwise, the mapping needs to define either \"normal\" or \"elite\" for the difficulty of the monster. If there are overlays for this room, those can be defined with the overlays attribute. This is a list of overlays which will be spawned when this room is opened. Loot tokens are not overlays and are defined in their own section. overlays: [ { name: \"Snow Rock\", position: [-3, 10], rotation: 180, }, ], Each overlay has the following properties: name The name of the overlay. This must match one of the defined overlays in the Overlays section. position The position of the overlay on the Grid. rotation The rotation of the overlay. This is optional and will default to the rotation of the defined overlay or 0 if there’s also nothing defined.

It generates the required scripts that needs to be added to a class registration, so that it can be picked up by the Enhancement Calculator. Additively load the tool into FHE or GHE while the class envelope is also on the table. Open the menu Options Game Keys and bind the Game Key \"Enhancement Tool: Add location\". This key is used to mark a location on an ability card while hovering it with the mouse. So something like left CTRL might work well. Right-click the class envelope and use the Setup Enhancements menu. This menu will copy all cards from the \"Starting Abilities\" and \"Advanced Abilities\" deck of the class envelope and move it to the tool. The camera will adjust to focus on the tool. While the deck is on the tool, you can use the Next button to move the top card from the deck, to the second position of the tool. This will then be the current card where enhancements can be edited. Clicking the Next button again, will move this card to the bottom of the deck and move the top card from the deck to the second slot again. The Previous button will do the reverse (place the current card on top of the deck and getting the new card from the bottom of the deck). Don’t draw or place cards manually and always use one of the buttons. The current card can than be edited by using the previously defined Game Key. Hover the card with the mouse and use the Game Key. A red cross-hair icon will appear on the card. This represents the location where the Enhancement Calculator will place the enhancement stickers later on. If you are not happy with the location, e.g. because it’s too war away from the actual spot, simply use the Game Key again and the cross-hair will move to the new place. Once you selected a current location this way, the tool will show additional options on the right to configure the enhancement spot. On the top you can see two buttons to define the current action (top/bottom) as a loss action or permanent action. In Frosthaven the enhancement price is dependent on this. Once you click them, they lighten up a bit to indicate they are currently active. Clicking them again, will remove the setting for the current action. Below, you find a checkbox that can be selected to indicate that the ability for the enhancement spot can potentially affect multiple figures/tiles/etc. Finally, there are buttons to define the shape of the enhancement spot. This defines which enhancement stickers can be put onto the enhancement spot. Clicking a shape will highlight it and reveal the final options for the enhancement spot. The enhancement costs depend on the type of ability, so it needs to be selected here for each enhancement spot. Use the 4 options preceded by a summon icon for enhancement spots on summons and the other for regular abilities. If an ability doesn’t fit one of the categories, use the last \"N/A\" option instead. This will prevent the +1 option to show up for this enhancement spot (e.g. see ability \"Flashing Flurry\" of Blinkblade, where a +1 doesn’t make any sense, but is technically allowed). There’s one option that can not be selected via the UI and has to be updated manually afterward: The movement of tokens (e.g. Deathwalker’s abilities). This can only be set in the generated script, by setting the type to move-token. The difference between the regular move type is that move-token won’t show Jump as a possible enhancement even for square shaped enhancements. After an option was clicked, a small icon will appear on the card indicating the previously selected shape. This will happen for all added enhancements and is retained even if the card is moved to the deck again. To remove an option again, simply use the Game Key again near the location of the icon. For hex enhancements a different view will show. Instead of selecting the ability type (since it’s not relevant for hex enhancements), instead the number of pre-printed hexes needs to be entered into a text field. Enter the number of existing hexes and click the Apply button to add the enhancement like any other. When all enhancements are done (or also before if you only want to generate partial scripts), use the Generate Script button. This will loop through the deck and read all added locations to generate the required script. You can find the script in the Notebook menu of TTS. There will be 2 notebooks: \"FHE 2.0\" and \"GHE 1.3\". The first one can be used if you are only interested using the class in Frosthaven Enhanced (and also Gloomhaven Enhanced once it reaches version 2.0). The other one can be used for both version as it also includes both the new format for enhancements, and the old format used by version 1.3 of GHE. Update the script of the class envelope to include the generated script and the class is ready to go. ClassApi.registerClass(\"MyClass\", { -- ... abilities = --- generated Script start { [\"Ability 1\"] = { -- ... } } --- generated Script end }) The script will set the ability level for all abilities based on the position of the card inside the deck sheet. The last two cards in the sheet will be considered to be level 9 cards, the next two cards level 8 cards and so on. The three cards before level 2 cards are then \"X\" cards and everything else will be a level 1 card. If this assumption is not correct for the class, you need to update the generated script afterward by adjusting the level property of each ability. Otherwise, the campaign manager might incorrectly load the class. The order in the deck on the table doesn’t matter. Only the order of the cards in the deck sheet is considered.","title":"Enhancement Tool","component":"custom","version":"2.3","name":"enhancementTool","url":"/custom/latest/tools/enhancementTool.html","titles":[]},"20":{"id":20,"text":"The section tool can be used to create PDF books with hidden sections that need to revealed via a button press. The tool is directly integrated into the GHE mod and can be used from there. To get started using the tool you first need a suitable object to work with. The object needs to have a required(\"Components.SectionBook\") Lua script attached, and it needs to be a custom PDF. To get started, you should first assign a hotkey for the tool. Open the Options Game Keys menu and assign a hotkey for \"Section Tool Add Point\" and \"Section Tool Undo Last Action\". Once this is done, place the book somewhere on the table and enter >section-tool-start into the chat window, while hovering over the book. This will start the edit mode for this book. You can now create hidden sections by \"drawing\" a rectangle with the \"Add Point\" hotkey. Move your cursor to the top left position of the rectangle you want to create and hit the \"Add Point\" hotkey. The ping arrow will show up to signal it was registered. Then move your cursor to the bottom right position of the rectangle and press the hotkey again. Again, the ping arrow will show up. Additionally, the created rectangle will now show up in the book as a black section with a button in its center. The button contains the id of the section and is auto-generated. The first part of the id is the current page number of the book and the second part is a letter. This letter will always count up by one to represent the number of created sections for this page. You can switch between the pages of the book, to create sections for the different pages. Once all sections you want to create are created, or you simply want to save your progress, enter >section-tool-save into the chat window while hovering over the book. This will save the created sections in the book, otherwise those are always temporary. The \"Section Tool Undo Last Action\" hotkey is useful to quickly undo small mistakes. When pressed after you created a rectangle it will remove the rectangle again, so you can redraw it. When pressed after setting the top left point of the rectangle it will remove the point internally, and you need to set it again. It’s currently not possible to undo more than one rectangle creation. The created section book can then be used in scenario definitions.","title":"Section Tool","component":"custom","version":"2.3","name":"sectionTool","url":"/custom/latest/tools/sectionTool.html","titles":[{"text":"Usage","hash":"_usage","id":1}]},"21":{"id":21,"text":"Actions are a mechanic to describe what you want the mod to do, without needing to script it. So you can define what you want to do and the mod then figures out how it will do it. It will also figure out, how an action is represented (e.g. through a button the user can click on). Currently, the only place where actions can be defined is in the scenario definition for overlay tiles. When an action is defined there, the overlay will automatically create a button which executes the action when a user clicks on it. You’ll probably know those buttons from doors and treasure chests, but they can be on any other overlay as well and do any other action as well (e.g. a treasure chest can be a door). In the future there will probably be other places as well where actions can be defined, e.g. a typical use-case would be something that happens when an enemy is defeated. Every action can set the following attributes which defines how the button for the action will be shown. Each action type also defines defaults for those values, so you don’t have to always set them (e.g. the name for a door action will be \"Open\" by default). The different types of actions will be listed in the following sections. Attributes name The name of the action, will also be shown as the text on the button. style Defines the visual style for the button. This defines the background color, the font size and the width of the button that is created for the action. confirm If set to true, a user has to confirm the action again, after clicking the button for this action. Otherwise, clicking the button directly executes the action. Example The following example shows an action in the context of a scenario definition. Here the action is attached to a pressure plate tile. It will create a button with the text \"Clockwise\" that executes a call action when clicked. rooms = { [1] = { overlayTiles = { { bag = ScenarioApi.OverlayType.Corridor, type = { { name = \"Pressure Plate\", tiles = { { position = { - 1.53, 1.88, 7.85}, rotation = {0.00, 30.00, 0.00}, tokens = { \"b\" }, action = { name = \"Clockwise\", call = { functionName = \"rotate100\", parameters = { 1 }, } }, } }, } }, } }, } } The door action is used to open rooms within the current scenario, just like the regular doors do. Objects with a door action attached are still only considered to be part of the room they are defined in. E.g. a regular door defined in the doorTiles section of a scenario will also spawn when one of the adjacent rooms is opened. An object with the door action will only spawn when the room where it is defined is opened. To get the regular door behaviour the object has to be defined in multiple rooms with the same settings. It will still only spawn once since a spawning object will be ignored when there’s already an object with the same name at the target location. Defaults name Open style Door confirm true Attributes Name Required Type Description rooms required List The list of room numbers that will be opened when this action is performed. Only rooms that weren’t opened before will be opened. Example action = { rooms = { 6, 2 } } The treasure action will reveal a treasure card and then destroy the object the action is attached to. Treasure cards will be searched for in the treasure deck or the bag containing additional treasure (see Treasure for details on how to add custom treasure). Defaults name The value of the treasure attribute style Treasure confirm false Attributes Name Required Type Description treasure required Number or String The name of the treasure that will be revealed. If the name is \"G\" the object is considered a goal treasure. No card is revealed and the object will not be destroyed when the action is performed.

Strings in formulas are considered to be variables and will be resolved in the given context (e.g. \"L\" or \"C\" like in the scenario book). Which variables are available depends on the context where the formula is used (see below). Arguments can be formulas, too which is used to E.g. the expression 2 + 4 * 5 would be defined as this formula; { \"+\", 2, { \"*\", 4, 5 } } --> resolves to 22 This shows that formulas are resolved from inner to outer. Before an operator can be executed all its arguments have to be resolved first. So in order for the addition to work, the multiplication formula will be resolved first. Looking at the Examples the usage should get clearer. :-) Operator Arguments Description + List Adds the resolved formula values. - List Subtracts the resolved formula values (left to right). * List Multiplies the resolved formula values. / List Divides the resolved formula values (left to right). roundUp Formula Rounds the resolved formula value up. roundDown Formula Rounds the resolved formula value down. apply 2 or 3 Calls a function and returns the function’s value. The name of the function is the first argument. If the second argument is a String, this is the GUID of the object that contains the function. Then the third argument is the table of parameters passed to the function. Otherwise, the second argument is the table of parameters passed to the function and the function has to be on the object that defines the formula. Variables within the parameters will also be resolved. if A List with 3 Formula Checks if the first argument value is true. If this is the case, it will return the second argument’s value, otherwise it will return the third argument’s value. byScenarioLevel List Return the formula Variable Context Description C All The number of player characters. L All The current scenario level. H Enemies The standard HP value for the enemy at the current scenario level and difficulty. self All The GUID of the object for which the formula is calculated. Global All A reference to the Global object. Every number is a formula in itself, so it can be used directly. hp = 4 Variables are also a formula in itself. hp = \"L\" The four basic arithmetic operators can be used like this: hp = { \"+\", \"C\", 3} -- C + 3 hp = { \"-\", \"C\", 3} -- C - 3 hp = { \"*\", \"H\", 2} -- H * 2 hp = { \"/\", \"H\", 2} -- H / 2 Multiple operators can be combined with an argument as a formula table. hp = { \"+\", 20, \"L\", {\"*\", 2, \"C\"}, } -- 20 + L + (2 * C) With division, rounding is also relevant. hp = { \"roundUp\", { \"/\", {\"*\", \"H\", \"C\"}, 2 } } -- (H * C) / 2, rounded up To mimic monster stats it’s possible to use the byScenarioLevel operator. It returns the value from the argument afterwards, that matches the current scenario level. E.g. the following formula would return 1 for scenario level 0 and 1, 2 for scenario level 2 and so forth: hp = { \"byScenarioLevel\", 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 } Functions can be called, too. Since Strings are considered to be variables, they have to be prefixed with a $ if the literal String is meant (e.g. for the function name to be called). This also applies to all values inside the parameters of the apply operator. E.g. this example will set the HP value of the object the formula is attached to, to the same value as the \"Prime Demon\" enemy has. hp = { \"apply\", \"$setHealthFromEnemy\", \"Global\", { enemy = \"$Prime Demon\", object = \"self\" }, } It might be useful to combine the if operator with the apply operator. E.g. this example will either resolve to the value 0 or 1, depending on whether the current party has the \"Dimensional Equilibrium\" achievement or not (which is checked by the hasPartyAchievement function). levelModifier = { \"if\", { \"apply\", \"$hasPartyAchievement\", \"Global\", { name = \"$Dimensional Equilibrium\" }, }, 0, 1 }","title":"Formula","component":"custom","version":"2.3","name":"formula","url":"/custom/latest/common/formula.html","titles":[{"text":"Available Operators","hash":"_available_operators","id":1},{"text":"Available Variables","hash":"_available_variables","id":2},{"text":"Examples","hash":"Example_Formula","id":3}]},"23":{"id":23,"text":"Spawnable elements are a way to define objects that can be spawned by certain actions. They define which objects should be created and what properties they should have. The mod uses the information to pull the correct object and apply the properties to it. Currently, they can be used to define the content for the Context Menu as well as for the Spawn Action within a scenario definition. Each Spawnable Element definition has two required properties: The type of the element (e.g. an obstacle, trap, enemy, etc.) and its name. The type tells the mod where to look for the object and the name determines which object from that place it spawns. Both those properties are defined within the element property. To get access to the different types, use the ElementType table in the ResourceApi (as seen in the example). Example 1. Definition for a Boulder obstacle local R = require(\"api.Resource\") local spawnableElement = { element = { type = R.ElementType.Obstacle, name = \"Boulder\", } } There are also additional properties that can be set for all elements that support them (most overlays do). E.g. conditions, current/maximum HP or scenario aid tokens. Example 2. Additional properties for an element local R = require(\"api.Resource\") local spawnableElement = { element = { type = R.ElementType.Obstacle, name = \"Boulder\", -- Add the scenario aid tokens A and B to the object tokens = {\"a\", \"b\"}, -- Add the Wound condition to the object conditions = {\"Wound\"}, -- sets the current HP. If hpMax is not used, this is also the maximum HP hp = 3, -- sets the maximum HP hpMax = { \"+\", \"C\", 1}, } } The properties hp and hpMax can be an Formula. Some elements, like traps and enemies, also have additional properties. Example 3. Definition for a trap with damage and conditions local R = require(\"api.Resource\") local spawnableElement = { element = { type = R.ElementType.Trap, name = \"Bear Trap\", conditions = { \"Stun\" }, -- Defines the amount of damage this trap does damage = 3, } } Example 4. Definition for a summonable enemy local R = require(\"api.Resource\") local spawnableElement = { element = { type = R.ElementType.Enemy, name = \"Living Bones\", -- Spawns at elite difficulty. If not used, \"normal\" is the default difficulty = \"elite\", } } To make Spawnable Elements appear in the Context Menu, they have to be added to the ability information of the class or enemy which can create them, by using the spawn property. For classes, this is part of the class information used for registerClass. Example 5. Definition within a class ability local ClassApi = require(\"api.ClassApi\") local R = require(\"api.Resource\") ClassApi.registerClass(\"Doomstalker\", { abilities = { [\"Detonation\"] = { level = 1, enhancements = {}, spawn = { { element = { type = R.ElementType.Trap, name = \"Spike Trap\", damage = 3, } } } }, } } Currently, the element will show up in the Context Menu, if the ability is somewhere present on the table (so not necessarily if it was placed for the current round). The tooltip in the Context Menu will show which ability defined the element, so it’s easier for users to spawn the correct one. It’s also possible to define Spawnable Elements on the top level of a class definition. Then the element will always show up in the Context Menu regardless of which ability is present. This is useful if the class has lots of abilities that spawn the same element. Using the definition in the abilities would clutter the Context Menu with multiple entries of the same element, so this is a way to prevent that. Example 6. Definition within a class local ClassApi = require(\"api.ClassApi\") local R = require(\"api.Resource\") ClassApi.registerClass(\"Doomstalker\", { spawn = { { element = { type = R.ElementType.Trap, name = \"Spike Trap\", damage = 3, } } } }) For enemies this is done in the ability deck definition used for registerEnemyAbilityDeck. Example 7. Definition within an enemy ability deck local EnemyApi = require(\"api.EnemyApi\") local R = require(\"api.Resource\") EnemyApi.registerEnemyAbilityDeck(\"Archer\", { abilities = { [7] = { image = \"...\", spawn = { { element = { type = R.ElementType.Trap, name = \"Spike Trap\", damage = 3, }, } }, }, Defining the elements for bosses works the same, though they use a different API. Example 8. Definition within a boss local EnemyApi = require(\"api.EnemyApi\") local R = require(\"api.Resource\") EnemyApi.registerBossEnemy(\"Human Commander\", { icon = \"...\", spawn = { { element = { type = R.ElementType.Enemy, name = \"City Guard\", }, }, { element = { type = R.ElementType.Enemy, name = \"City Archer\", }, }, } }) In all instances above, the spawn property is a list of elements, so its possible to put multiple elements in there (as can be seen in the boss example). Be sure to use the correct number of nesting levels of { } even when using only 1 element. In addition to the element property, Spawnable Elements also have an optional action property, where you can define Actions. This can be useful when using the Spawn Action in a scenario definition. E.g. there are scenarios with secret rooms that get revealed when a button is pressed. The button creates a door object to the new secret room, by using the Spawn Action. The action within the Spawnable Element then defines, that the newly spawned door object will really have the \"Open\" button attached to it. Otherwise, it would just be a token. Example 9. Definition of an overlay that also acts as a door local spawnableElement = { element = { type = Scenario.OverlayType.Door, name = \"Stone Door Horizontal\", }, action = { -- open Room 2 and 6 of the scenario, when the button is pressed rooms = {6, 2} }, }, While this is currently only used in scenario definitions, it’s also possible to use that feature for the objects in the Context Menu (a class that can spawn doors, how cool would that be?). The final property of a Spawnable Element is the placement property. This is used to determine where and at what rotation the new object will be spawned. It has two properties position and rotation, which each take a 3 dimensional vector of the absolute position/rotation within TTS. Example 10. Defining the placement of an object local spawnableElement = { element = { type = Scenario.OverlayType.Door, name = \"Stone Door Horizontal\", }, action = { rooms = {6, 2} }, placement = { position = { -3.03, 1.77, 21.00}, rotation = { 0, 210, 0 }, }, }, When using the element for the Context Menu this property is not required and actually ignored because spawning from the Context Menu has its own logic to determine the position for the object. To easily get that information, after you place an object somewhere on the table, use the Command Line, to print it to the screen (and the Atom console, where you can easily copy it from).","title":"Spawnable Element","component":"custom","version":"2.3","name":"spawnable","url":"/custom/latest/common/spawnable.html","titles":[{"text":"Defining a Spawnable Element","hash":"_defining_a_spawnable_element","id":1},{"text":"Using Spawnable Elements for the Context Menu","hash":"_using_spawnable_elements_for_the_context_menu","id":2},{"text":"Adding actions","hash":"_adding_actions","id":3},{"text":"Defining the placement of the new object","hash":"_defining_the_placement_of_the_new_object","id":4}]},"24":{"id":24,"text":"Add the information for the tracker image directly to the class' data.

First check out the version specific sections here for hints (for both the version to migrate from and the version to migrate to). If the mod fails to fill some containers with all objects (e.g. missing cards in the town guard or personal quest deck), you can find extra copies of all objects in the Frosthaven game box. There’s a bag called \"AutoAssets\" inside which contains copies of all used assets in the game. Inside are multiple other bags grouped by their function. Get the one you need and find the objects you are missing. Be aware of spoilers! This is a syncing issue with TTS. All players should restart TTS and restart the game. Unfortunately, there’s nothing the mod itself can do about it. Some players might experience an issue with cards or other assets showing up like this: This is a TTS cache error which can be resolved by downloading all the assets again. The effected players either need to disable mod caching in TTS to it downloads the broken assets again. Or they can pre download all the mod’s assets and replaced their current cached files. Afterward, mod caching can be enabled again to improve performance. When a migration is started from version 2.2 to a newer version, the town guard deck might be wrong in the new version. This is due to the fact that the town guard mat was wrong in this version and the deck is misaligned on its mat. To work around this, slightly move the active town guard deck lower on its mat, like shown here: In order to achieve this, you first have to right-click the deck and remove the \"Snap\" and \"Grid\" options from the \"Toggles\" menu. Otherwise, the deck will move right back to its original place. This error can show up in versions prior to 2.3 when trying to migrate the campaign to a newer version. It will prevent some parts of the campaign to be migrated. The following steps can be done to work around this problem: Find your TTS save file on your hard drive (check the knowledge base to find the location for your system). Open the file with a text editor (any editor that supports a find and replace function is enough). Search for the following text a.index <= b.index and replace it with a.index < b.index. The search should show up 3 matches. Search for the text a.name <= b.name and replace it with a.name < b.name. The search should show up 1 match. Save the TTS save file and load it again in TTS The migration will all information is now possible.","title":"Known bugs and workarounds","component":"mod","version":"2.3","name":"knownBugs","url":"/mod/latest/frosthaven/knownBugs.html","titles":[{"text":"Version independent","hash":"_version_independent","id":1},{"text":"Missing objects after migration","hash":"missing-objects","id":2},{"text":"Buttons show up at weird places for non-host players","hash":"weird-buttons","id":3},{"text":"Some assets show up as completely white or yellow for some players","hash":"broken-assets","id":4},{"text":"Version 2.2","hash":"_version_2_2","id":5},{"text":"Migrating to a newer version leaves an empty town guard deck","hash":"town-guard-empty","id":6},{"text":"Error invalid order function for sorting during campaign migration","hash":"invalid-sort-order","id":7}]},"36":{"id":36,"text":"Other Missing/Upcoming Features New Initiative Tracker UI is in the works!

Otherwise, TTS will download assets when you first encounter them. This is typically a bit slower than downloading an asset manually, and can lead to de-syncs or weird behavior in multiplayer games Each player downloads the assets individually, but players that already finished downloading can interact with the game pieces which may make things for the loading players not working correctly afterward. By pre-downloading the assets this problem can be circumvented and loading new content (like encountering new monsters, unlocking classes, etc.) is a bit smoother in general. The whole assets of the mod are around 4GB in total. To pre-download the assets, go to https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1I136KhBufKiaWh8nCGrk-gxLIBnMhNSO and download all files there by downloading the individual directories.

This is particularly useful for chests that give loot cards. When the active player highlights a loot token and hits the Cleanup Action Game Key. That token is moved to their player mat and a loot card is drawn for them. When a character ends their turn in the Initiative Tracker by turning their line from black to red, all loot tokens in their current hex are moved to their player mat and the appropriate number of loot cards are drawn from the loot deck.

The list of available Game Keys can be found while accessing the Options Game Keys menu. This section gives an overview of the available game actions that can be bound to a key. Each player has to assign the Game Key themselves if they want to use it. There’s no way to share assigned Game Keys or assign default keys in the mod. Assigned keys will stay between mod versions. When migrating from 2.0.0 to v2.1.0 or beyond, the Quick Menu and the Cleanup Action has been renamed and must be re-mapped by all users. Assigning a Game Key does not prevent the TTS default behavior for that key. E.g. if you assign the key \"F\" to a Game Key and use it while hovering over an object, it will still flip the object in addition to performing the game action. However, as stated above, this means those keys have to reassigned for each player, if they want to use them again. The two most useful Game Keys are the Quick Menu and the Cleanup Action. While hovering over a character ability card, this will open the Enhancement Calculator. While hovering over a card in a player’s hand, these keys will place this card in the 1st/2nd/3rd ability card slot on the Play Area. If there’s already a card present, it will be moved to the player’s hand again. This also works regardless of player color. E.g. if you are the Black player and use this Game Key while hovering over a hand zone card for the Blue player, it will move the cards to the slot for the Blue player. In addition to the Game Key you set here, the numbers at the top of the keyboard 1, 2, and 3 will set cards in their respective card slots on the Play Area. While hovering over an ability card, this Game Key will move the card to the discard pile or the next free spot in the active area. Those Game Keys are mainly meant when using Picture in Picture mode on the player mat. Buttons don’t work inside the PiP window, but Game Keys do. This key will sort your hand in numerical order. When playing solo, it will sort only the active hand when pressed. Geminate’s hand does not split the sort into its two forms at this time. While hovering a deck or a bag, this Game Key will open the Search Window for this container. This key will undo the most recent deletion. Accidentally delete a battle goal instead of returning it to the deck? Hit this key. This key will toggle the terrain type highlighted. At this time, the function is not extended beyond use in Scenario 0. While hovering over a figure or token with a health bar, this key will add/remove one health from it. While hovering over a character, this key will add/remove one XP. While hovering over a character figure that has a stance bar, this key will move the active stance to the left or right. While hovering over a character figure that has a resource bar, this key will add or remove a resource from the specific resource bar. This action will draw a new Attack Modifier card from the enemy deck. This key switches the player color to the next available player color that has a character loaded. This is intended for solo or multi-handed play. These actions quickly switch to the player seat associated with this player number. For the Solo player, it will switch to the Black player color. The switch is only successful if there isn’t already another player seated for this player color. Unfortunately, there’s no way to preserve the current camera position before switching. So instead of defaulting to moving the camera far away like, the camera will focus on the character mat for this player instead. The camera behavior is the same as the one mentioned in the \"Switch To Player\" section.

On this page you will find detailed explanations of all commands and syntax options available in the Card Creator. Note: The Card Creator currently has a few issues with rendering certain elements in browsers other than Chrome. If you encounter any problems, please try using Chrome for the best experience. Before you begin creating your cards, it’s recommended to set up some base info, and define some properties. These properties will be used to customise the look of your custom class. These steps aren’t strictly required, but it can help you to reinforce the thematic identity of your class. The base info section is where you can define all the aspects of your class that don’t involve the cards themselves, such as the info presented on the class mat. Here is a brief overview of the properties you can define: Property Description Name The name of your custom class. Race The race of your class. HP Track The HP level of your class. This can be set to Low, Medium, or High. Spoiler Name The name of your class given to it based on its icon. Complexity The complexity of your class. This can be set to any number between 1 and 5. Melee The melee value of your class. This can be set to any number between 1 and 5. Ranged The ranged value of your class. This can be set to any number between 1 and 5. Mobility The mobility value of your class. This can be set to any number between 1 and 5. Support The support value of your class. This can be set to any number between 1 and 5. Defense The defense value of your class. This can be set to any number between 1 and 5. Control The control value of your class. This can be set to any number between 1 and 5. Elemental Affinities The elemental affinities of your class. This can be set to a comma-separated list of elements that your class is proficient in, or none. Background Size The size of the background image for your class on the banner in the class list. This banner can also be seen at the top of the page. This is set to a pixel amount. Note: The image that this uses will be set later, when making a TTS mod. Background Position The position of the background image for your class on the banner in the class list. This is based from the top left corner, and is set to two pixel amounts, one for the x-axis and one for the y-axis. CCUG Development Status The development status of your class. This can be set to any of the following: \"Concept\", \"Alpha\", \"Beta\", \"Released\". Discord Link A link to the Discord channel for your class. Public Whether your class is public or not. This can be set to true or false. Add User You can enter discord user IDs here to allow those users to edit the class. This is useful for collaborative projects. To create a deck, head to the \"Decks\" tab in the Card Creator, and click the \"Add\" button. This will create a new deck for your class. You can then open this deck by clicking it’s name in the list, or the \"Cards\" button next to the deck. Once a deck is created, and you have opened it by either clicking on it, or clicking the \"Cards\" button next to it, you’ll be brought to the screen you’ll be spending the majority of your time in. This is the deck building screen. Immediately, you’ll be able to see two buttons, \"Show starting deck\" and \"Show advanced deck\". Once you’ve started creating cards, you can use these buttons to see the entire level 1/X spread, and the entire level 2-9 spread, respectively. Below that are 4 more buttons, \"Show properties\", \"Show color properties\", \"Change base card\", and \"Elements\". Clicking on any of these will show the respective section, which can be closed by clicking the button again. If it doesn’t seem like clicking a button is showing anything, try scrolling down, as the section may be below another section. One thing to note about the following sections is that for some of the options (especially the color properties), it’ll be easier to see what they do once you’ve actually started creating cards. You can either skip to the Adding Cards section to start creating cards, or continue reading to see what each section does. The \"Show properties\" section is where you can see, and set, various properties for the deck. This includes the name of the deck, a link to the icon of the class, various links to different class tokens, allowing you to add custom images to cards (this is explained in more detail in the Basic Actions, and the Custom Actions section), and a link to the background image for the cards in this deck. You can also set the position of this background image, the opacity, and the size of it. This will be much easier to see once you’ve actually started creating cards. The \"Show color properties\" section is where you can set the color of various parts of the card. This is split into two sections, the colors for the card itself, and the colors for the various bits that go on the card. The top line of colors are for the various parts that go onto the card. Most of these will usually want to remain default, except for the \"Line color\", but you can experiment with these to see what you like. The top bars are for transparency, and the bottom bars are for the colors themselves. The actual card colors are controlled a bit differently. Here, each section of the card has access to a range of sliders, \"Sepia\", \"Saturate\", \"Hue-rotation\", and \"Brightness\". These sliders can be used to adjust the color of the card, and the various parts of the card. The \"Brightness\" slider is particularly useful for making the text on the card more readable. The \"Hue-rotation\" slider can be used to change the color of the card, and the \"Saturate\" slider can be used to make the card more, or less, colorful. The \"Sepia\" slider can be used to make the card more, or less, sepia-toned. It can be a bit tricky to get the colors you want, but with a bit of experimentation, you should be able to settle on something like what you envisioned. To the right of each of the rows of sliders, you’ll see a checkbox on all but the first row. Any rows that have this checkbox checked will change automatically as you change the sliders on the first row. This can be useful for keeping the colors of the card and the elements on the card in sync. If you want to change certain parts of the card, but not others, you can uncheck the checkbox on the row you want to change, and then adjust the sliders as needed. The \"Change base card\" section is where you can change the base card that all the cards in the deck are based on. This is useful if you want to change the base visuals of the card, outside changing colors. Most people won’t need to change this, but it’s there if you want to. Every part of the card can be changed, and this change will be reflected across the entire deck. The \"Elements\" section shows a quick overview of the elements that are present in the deck. This is useful for keeping track of how many infusions, and consumptions, are in the deck. This can be helpful for balancing the deck, and making sure that you have a balanced amount of elements in the deck. While inside the deck building screen, you can add cards to the deck by clicking the \"Add Card\" button. This will create a new card in the deck. You can then edit this card by clicking on it. This will bring it into focus next to the text box containing its code. This state, where the card is in focus, doubles as the best way to see the changes you’re making in the previous properties sections. This is because the card will update in real time as you change the properties of the card. The syntax of the Card Creator uses simple commands to render icons and values. Commands typically follow this structure: - command: [value] Modifiers can be added to fine-tune placement, styling, or functionality. Sections below break down each command group. For many examples on card structure, including all the examples shown in this documentation, feel free to browse the \"Example Syntax\" class present in the tool. The structure of a card is based on indentation. Every sub-block or modifier must be indented with exactly 2 spaces more than its parent. This tells the system which modifiers belong to which command. For the purposes of this guide, \"parent\" refers to the block that is one level higher in the hierarchy. For example: - attack: 3 margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px In this example, the \"margin\" modifier is indented 2 spaces relative to the \"- attack: 3\" command, indicating that it applies specifically to that action. Here is a more complex example: - group: - attack: 3 - divider margin: 10px 0px - move: 2 - divider - optional: - consume: [dark,light] - heal: 2 sub: - range: 3 - wild noLine: true flexDirection: column In this example, we have utilized a \"group\" block to contain multiple actions. Each action is indented 2 spaces relative to the \"group\" command. This indicates that they all belong to that outer block. The hierarchy continues with the \"divider\" and \"optional\" blocks, each containing their own sub-blocks. A more detailed explanation of each block type is provided in the following sections. Remember: use 2 spaces per level of indentation to maintain the proper hierarchy. This section covers the core actions used to define a card’s abilities. Syntax Description Example Result - attack: [value] Creates an attack ability with a value of [value] - attack: 3 3 - move: [value] Creates a move ability with a value of [value] - move: 3 3 - teleport: [value] Creates a teleport ability with a value of [value] - teleport: 3 3 - shield: [value] Creates a shield ability with a value of [value] - shield: 1 1 - retaliate: [value] Creates a retaliate ability with a value of [value] - retaliate: 1 1 - loot: [value] Creates a loot ability with a value of [value] - loot: 1 1 - heal: [value] Creates a heal ability with a value of [value] - heal: 1 1 - classToken: [index] Creates a class token ability using the token linked to the specified index. - classToken: 0 Conditions modify abilities and can be used with or without an associated value. The available conditions are: bane bless brittle chill curse disarm dodge empower enfeeble immobilize impair infect invisible muddle pierce poison pull push regenerate rupture safeguard strengthen stun swing ward wound Syntax Description Example Result - [condition] Renders a condition icon. - poison - [condition]: [value] Renders a condition icon with an optional value. - pierce: 1 1 Elements represent various thematic or mechanical attributes. They support single values, consumption markers, and infuse modifiers. Available elements include: earth fire air (or wind) ice light dark wild Using multiple elements separated by '/' will generate an “or” condition. Syntax Description Example Result - [element] Renders the icon for the given element. - air - consume: [ elements…​ ] Renders a list of element icons with an added consume marker (usually used within an optional block). - consume: [wind/fire] infuse: [ elements…​ ] Adds a mandatory box with a list of specified elements. (Note: As a modifier, do not prefix with a '-') infuse: [earth/wild] [!] Note: The square brackets in the consume and infuse examples are required in the syntax. Note: For infusion, this will only work at the first indentation level. This means that either bottom: or top: should be its direct parent. There exists a special block for custom actions, which allows you to write any text you want. This block is useful for creating unique abilities or actions that don’t fit into the predefined categories. Within these blocks, you are able to insert any of the common icons, such as conditions or elements, to further customize your text. This includes any class tokens that you’ve linked in the properties section. The syntax for inserting these icons is: %iconName%. Here are some examples of custom actions: Syntax Description Example Result - custom: [text] Creates a custom action with the specified text. - custom: 'Text' Text - custom: [text] Creates a custom action with the specified text. - custom: 'Text with %poison% poison' Text with poison - custom: [text] Creates a custom action with the specified text. - custom: 'Text with %dark% dark and %fire% fire' Text with dark and fire - custom: [text] Creates a custom action with the specified text. - custom: 'Text with %classToken0% a custom class token' Text with a custom class token Any icon that has been inserted also has some special modifiers that can be applied to it. These modifiers are: Modifier Description Example Result 's' Removes the icon’s shadow. %classToken0s% 'i' Inverts the icon’s color. %banei% Sub Blocks are the blocks that house the extra properties of an action. These are things like range, target, and other modifiers that can be applied to an action. These blocks are always indented 2 spaces from their parent action, like so: - attack: 3 sub: target: 2 range: 3 pierce: 1 In this example, the \"sub\" block contains the \"target\", \"range\", and \"pierce\" modifiers. These are all indented 2 spaces from the \"attack\" command, indicating that they are all part of that action. Alongside all existing conditions, the available attributes you can put in a sub block are: target range Optional blocks represent abilities, or augments to abilities that come with a cost. The most frequent example of an optional block is an elemental consumption. This would be represented as follows: - attack: 3 - optional: - consume: [earth] - custom: '+2 %attack%' The above will render an attack 3 ability with an optional block that consumes earth and adds +2 attack. Sometimes, an optional block may be used to represent an extra ability, rather than an augment to an ability. An example of this would be: - move: 3 - divider - optional: - consume: [earth] - heal: 2 noLine: true In this example, we have a move 3 ability with an optional block that allows the consumption of earth to perform an additional heal 2. The noLine modifier is used to prevent a line from being drawn between the move and heal abilities, since in this case they are separate abilities. Mandatory blocks are used to represent abilities that must be performed if that action is being played. Outside elemental infusion (which is created automatically with the infuse modifier), mandatory blocks are most often used to force a negative action to occur. An example of this would be: - attack: 3 - divider - mandatory: - curse: sub: - self In this example, we have an attack 3 ability with a mandatory block that means the player has to curse themselves. The tokens block creates token slots. Each number in the provided array represents the XP that the token slot provides. Syntax Description Example Result - tokens: [0,1,0,1] Creates token slots with XP values as defined in the array. - tokens: [0,1,0,1] Renders token slots accordingly. Modifiers for tokens allow you to control how token slots are arranged. Modifier Description Example Result lines Forces tokens to render in a specific layout: either 3 or 4 tokens on 1 or 2 lines. Other numbers follow predefined arrangements (1–2 tokens on one line, 5–6 tokens on two lines). - tokens: [0,1,0,1] lines: 1 Renders tokens in a single line. Summons are a special type of action that can be created using the \"summon\" block. This is one of the more complex blocks, as it has a lot of properties that can be set. Here is an example of a basic summon block: - custom: 'Summon Example Summon' - summon: name: 'Example Summon' stats: [5,2,3,'-'] image: image: url: \"https://example.com/image.png\" size: 100% position: '0px 0px' In this example, we have a custom action that creates a summon called \"Example Summon\". This summon has 5 health, 2 move, 3 attack, and no range. The summon also has an image, which is set to a URL, and has various properties to position the image in the image box. Here are all the properties that can be set for a summon: Property Description Example Result name The name of the summon. name: 'Example Summon' The summon will be called \"Example Summon\" in TTS. stats The stats of the summon. This should be an array of 4 numbers, in the order of health, move, attack, range. stats: [5,2,3,'-'] The summon will have 5 health, 2 move, 3 attack, and no range. image The image of the summon. This should be an object with the properties \"url\", \"size\", and \"position\". This will also be used for the TTS standee. image: url: \"https://example.com/image.png\" size: 100% position: '0px 0px' The summon will have an image from the URL \"https://example.com/image.png\", with a size of 100%, and a position of 0px 0px. enhancement The possible enhancements on the summon. This should be an array of the possible enhancements, or \"none\" if there is no enhancement for that attribute. The array follows the same order as the stats array. enhancement: [square,none,square,none] The summon will have a square enhancement for health and attack, and no enhancement for move and range. special The special abilities of the summon. These are things like shield, retaliate, or other abilities that the summon performs. It will show up to the right of the stats. special: - shield: 1 The summon will have a shield 1 ability. background The background color of the special area. This should be in rgb form as shown in the example. background: 'rgb(255,0,0,50%)' The background of the special area will be red with 50% opacity. width The width of the special area. This should be in pixels. width: 100px The special area will be 100 pixels wide. There are further properties that can be set for a summon. These extra properties won’t change the appearance of the card, but will change the behavior of the summon in TTS. These properties are: Property Description Example Result attributes The attributes of the summon. This is something like if the summon is flying, or if it has a shield. Setting this will make the attributes appear under the standees health. attributes: 'Shield = 1' The summon will have a shield value of 1. effects The effects of the summon. This is something like if the summon wounds on their attacks. Setting this will make the effects appear under the standees health. effects: '\"Wound\"' The summon standee will show that they wound on their attacks. text The text that appears on the summon standee. This can be anything you want, and will appear under the effects. This text can include icons like range and attack, but the syntax is different. To include an icon, include {e.IconName} in the text, where \"iconName\" is the name of the icon you want to include. text: 'This is some example text with {e.Range} range and {e.Attack} attack.' The summon standee will show \"This is some example text with range and attack.\" immunities The immunities of the summon. This is something like if the summon is immune to poison. immunities: 'Poison' The summon will be immune to poison. hpColor The color of the health bar on the summon standee. This should be in hex code form as shown in the example. hpColor: '#ff0000' The health bar on the summon standee will be red. hpColorText The color of the health text on the summon standee. This should be in hex code form as shown in the example. hpColorText: '#ffffff' The health text on the summon standee will be white. Named ability blocks are used to create a small banner in the top left corner of the card. This is useful when you have certain keyword abilities that have special rules defined on the class mat. A starter class that uses this is Mindthief, with its \"augment\" abilities. Note: this block only refers to the corner containing the keyword, not the banner containing the abilities. For help with the abilities banner, see the Advanced Styling section. In order to use this block, it should be placed at the base level of the action, with only \"top:\" or \"bottom:\" as a parent. Here is an example: - top: namedAbility: name: Augment The mode block can be used to create something akin to Blinkblade’s fast or slow abilities. Here is an example of how to use the mode block: - mode: - attack: 2 icon: '%classToken0%' In this example, we have a mode block that contains an attack 2 ability, and an icon of the class token. The mode block has a couple of special properties that can be set. These are: Property Description Example Result icon The stuff that appears in the smalller box of the mode. icon: '%classToken0%' The icon of the class token will appear in the smaller box of the mode. reverse If set to true, the mode will be reversed. This means that the smaller box will be on the right, and the larger box will be on the left. reverse: true The mode will be reversed. leftBg The background color of the left box. This will usually be in rgb form as shown in the example. leftBg: 'rgb(255,0,0,50%)' The left box will have a red background with 50% opacity. rightBg The background color of the right box. This will usually be in rgb form as shown in the example. rightBg: 'rgb(0,255,0,50%)' The right box will have a green background with 50% opacity. borderBg The background color of the border between the two boxes. This will usually be in rgb form as shown in the example. borderBg: 'rgb(0,0,255,50%)' The border between the two boxes will be blue with 50% opacity. Before we get into more advanced styling options, here are some common properties for an action and how they can be used. Do note that all of these properties should be a direct child of the \"bottom:\" or \"top:\" block, just like the \"infuse:\" block. Syntax Description Example Result duration: [value] Sets the duration of the action. This can be either \"round\" or \"persistent\". duration: round The symbol will appear in the mandatory box in the bottom right corner of the card. lost: [value] Sets if the card is lost or not. This can be either \"true\" or \"false\". lost: true The action will have a icon in the mandatory box in the bottom right corner of the card. remove: [value] Sets whether the card is unrecoverable or not. This can be either \"true\" or \"false\". remove: true The action will have a icon in the mandatory box in the bottom right corner of the card. xp: [value] Sets the XP value of the action. This can be any number. xp: 1 The XP value will appear in the mandatory box in the bottom right corner of the card. Modifiers allow you to fine-tune the placement, size, and appearance of each block. To apply modifiers, ensure each block is defined as an object (i.e. using a colon after the block name). These style modifiers can be applied to any block, and should not have a hyphen in front of them. For example, to apply a modifier to an attack action, you would write: - attack: 3 margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px fontSize: 10px Modifier Description Example Result margin Sets the margin around the block. This has a variety of ways to be set, as shown in the following examples. margin: 5px 0px 0px 5px margin: 5px 0px 10px margin: 5px 0px margin: 5px The first example will set the margin to 5px on the top, 0px on the right, 0px on the bottom, and 5px on the left. The second example will set the margin to 5px on the top, 0px on the sides, and 10px on the bottom. The third example will set the margin to 5px on the top and bottom, and 0px on the sides. The last example will set the margin to 5px on all sides. padding Sets the padding around the block. This has a variety of ways to be set, as shown in the following examples. padding: 5px 0px 0px 5px padding: 5px 0px 10px padding: 5px 0px padding: 5px The first example will set the padding to 5px on the top, 0px on the right, 0px on the bottom, and 5px on the left. The second example will set the padding to 5px on the top, 0px on the sides, and 10px on the bottom. The third example will set the padding to 5px on the top and bottom, and 0px on the sides. The last example will set the padding to 5px on all sides. Note: Padding is similar to margin, but they have separate use cases. Taking an optional block as an example, setting padding on the block will increase the amount of space that the block itself takes up, while setting margin will increase the space between the block and the action above it. You can think of padding as the space inside the block, while margin is the space outside the block. There are many more style modifiers that can be applied to blocks. Here are the rest of them: Modifier Description Example Result fontSize Sets the font size of the text in the block. This can be any number, and will be set in pixels. fontSize: 10px The font size of the text in the block will be 10px. height Sets the height of the block. This can be any number, and will be set in pixels. height: 10px The height of the block will be 10px. display Sets the display type of the block. This can be set to anything that is valid in CSS, but in almost every case, you don’t want to change this. display: flex The block will be set to display as a flexbox. flexDirection Sets the direction that the content in the block will follow. This can be set to \"row\" or \"column\". Row will put the content in a row, while column will put the content in a column. flexDirection: column The content in the block will be set to display in a column. background Sets the background color of the block. This can be set to any color that is valid in CSS, including rgb, and rgba. background: rgb(255,0,0,50%) The background color of the block will be set to red with 50% opacity. color Sets the color of the text in the block. This can be set to any color that is valid in CSS, including rgb, and rgba. color: rgb(255,0,0,50%) The color of the text in the block will be set to red with 50% opacity. wordSpacing Sets the spacing between words in the block. This can be set to any number, and will be set in pixels. wordSpacing: 5px The spacing between words in the block will be set to 5px. lineHeight Sets the height of each line in the block. This can be set to any number, and will be set in pixels. This is useful for making the text more readable. lineHeight: 5px The height of each line in the block will be set to 5px. gap Sets the gap between the items in the block. This can be set to any number, and will be set in pixels. This is useful for more advanced blocks that we’ll get into later. gap: 5px The gap between the items in the block will be set to 5px. To change a block’s position, orientation, or size, use the following modifiers: Modifier Description Example Result position Sets positioning mode: relative (based on surrounding elements) or absolute (based on the parent element). position: absolute The block will be positioned absolutely. top Adjusts vertical placement from the top edge of the parent or relative container. top: 10px Adjusts vertical placement from the top edge, placing the block 10px down. left Adjusts horizontal placement from the left edge. left: 10px Adjusts horizontal placement from the left edge, placing the block 10px to the right. transform Applies CSS transformations (e.g., rotate, scale). Refer to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform for more info. transform: scale(2) Doubles the size of the block. This section will be dedicated to more advanced styling, to achieve the desired look for your cards. This includes things like the ability to create a banner, or a group of actions that are all part of the same action. The main block we care about here is the \"group\" block. This block is used to group actions together, allowing horizontal stacking, or easy positioning of multiple actions at once. One of the easiest examples to show this off is the aforementioned banner. On official cards, there are sometimes a group of actions at the top of the card in a separate \"banner\" area. Here’s an advanced example of how we can recreate something like that using the group block: top: namedAbility: name: Grenade padding: 10px 10px actions: - group: - attack: 2 sub: - custom: '%range% 2, advantage' margin: 0px -10px 0px 10px - hex: ett_ttt_ett marginTop: -40px paddingTop: 20px background: rgba(0,0,0,50%) - regenerate: marginTop: 10px sub: - self duration: persistent In this example, we have a group block that contains two actions, an attack and a AoE hex pattern. Group blocks default to a flexDirection of row, so the two actions will be placed next to each other. The group block also has a marginTop of -40px, which will pull the group up into the top area of the card. The paddingTop of 20px will add some space between the top of the group and the top of the card, allowing the darker background to extend seamlessly to the edge of the card. Finally, you can see the Named Ability block at the top, which is used to create the iconography in the corner of the banner group we’ve just created. The principles shown here can be applied to many different scenarios, and using a combination of everything shown so far, there is a lot of freedom available to you to create the card you want. Remember, you are able to access the example syntax class to see some examples of how to use these blocks, and how they can be combined to create the desired effect. Otherwise, experiment a little with the blocks, and see what you can come up with! When the time has come to export your class to Tabletop Simulator, there are a couple of things you need to do to make sure that your class works as intended. This section will cover the steps you need to take to make sure that your class works in Tabletop Simulator. The very first step will be to create a mod for your class on the \"TTS Mods\" page. This page works very similarly to the \"Decks\" page, but instead of creating cards, you’re creating mods for your class. Once you have created and opened a new mod, the main brunt of the work comes down to getting the various assets for your class sorted. This is all done within the mod that you created on the site. At the top of the mod page, there are a few things to fill in before getting to the assets. The first thing to do is to switch on the \"Active Mod\" toggle. This toggle is how TTS will know which mod to use when importing the class. In some cases, you’ll have multiple mods for the same class (for example if the class has two decks), and you’ll be able to import both decks by importing one, and then changing the active mod to the other. After this you have the Mod Name and the Deck Index. The mod name can be set to anything you want, it’s just so you know which mod is which in the list of mods on the class creator website. The deck index is the index of the deck you want to import. This is usually 0, but if you have multiple decks, you can set this to the index of the deck you want to import. Some people like to make a new deck for every version of the class they make, so they can keep track of changes, and if you’re doing this, you’ll need to change the deck index to the index of the deck you want to import. This starts at 0, and goes up by 1 for every new deck you make, so if you have 3 decks, you’ll have deck indexes 0, 1, and 2 (in the order they appear on the \"Decks\" page). Now come the assets themselves. The first thing to do is to add the starting deck to the mod. This can be done in two ways, but the second way will be covered in Third Party Card Spreads. For those who have created their class on the site, the starting deck will be created for you, and automatically saved. All you have to do is click the \"Upload Image\" button in the starting deck section. If you want to download an image of the starting deck, you can do so by clicking the \"Download Image\" button. Note: Downloading an image of the deck can be done without uploading it first, if you want to download an image of the deck before uploading it. You’ll notice beneath the image of the card spread two input boxes for the number of cards in each row and the number of rows. If you’re using the site to create your class, these will be filled in for you, but if you’re using a third party card spread, you’ll need to fill these in yourself. Finally, the last input box allows you to manually set snap points on the cards. This is an advanced feature, and will not need to be used often. In order to set these, click the \"Add snap\" button. This will begin the process of adding snap points. From there, just click the image of the spread in the locations where you want snap points to exist. You’ll be able to see them show up as red dots. When done, click \"Close add\". Note: Snap points are automatically generated for token tracks, you do not need to add these yourself. The advanced deck section is for the level 2-9 cards of the class. All the instructions for the starting deck apply here. There are a few more assets that are as simple to add as clicking \"Upload Image\". These are: The ability card back The character token bag The character token The tuckbox The class envelope The icon for the classlist These can also be linked to manually, if you have the URLs for the images. There are a few assets that need to be manually linked to. These are: The class mat front The class mat back The standee The character sheet The attack modifier deck The perk reminder deck In the case of the character sheet and the perks, you can use Sammy’s tool to create these. This is linked to underneath their input boxes. For the rest, you’ll need to upload the images to a hosting site, and then link to them in the input boxes. With the perks (both the AMD and the reminders), a list of the perks is needed. The AMD list should look something like the following, but in order of left to right reading through your specific perk cards: Attack Modifier (+0) Attack Modifier (+1) (Wound) Attack Modifier (+1) (Poison) Attack Modifier (+1) (Muddle) rolling Attack Modifer (ice-earth) rolling The \"Attack Modifier\" part is required, as is the \"rolling\" part if the perk is a rolling modifier. The rest is up to you, but it should communicate clearly to the player what the perk does. The perk reminder list should look something like the following: Perk Reminder long rest Perk Reminder short rest Perk Reminder refresh The \"Perk Reminder\" part is required, but the rest is up to you. This should communicate clearly to the player what the perk reminder does. There are a few final options that can be changed. First we have the HP bar color, HP bar text color, and HP bar placement. These are all pretty self explanatory, and are used to change the color of the health bar on the standee, the color of the text on the health bar, and the placement of the health bar on the standee. The colors can be set using hex codes, and the placement is set to a number, with the default being 320. Then there are all the character sheet and perk LUA scripts. These can be gotten from Sammy’s tool when you make the character sheet and the perks. They should just be copy and pasted into the input boxes. Finally, there is the option to add a custom standee script. This is for any extra scripting you want to add to the standee, such as a second HP bar. This is an advanced feature, and will not be needed for most classes. In order to import the class into TTS, you will first need to subscribe to the following mod on the Steam Workshop: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3163711044 Once you have subscribed to the mod, you can open TTS, and create a new game. In the game, you’ll need to go to the \"Workshop\" tab, and search for the mod you just subscribed to. Once you’ve found it, click the \"Load\" button, and the mod will be loaded into your game. Within this you will see a tile that allows you to enter a class name and generate the bag. Enter the name of the class you want to import, and click the button. This will create a bag with all the assets you need to play the class in TTS. To upload this bag as your own Steam Workshop mod so that others can download and play your class, follow these steps: Delete the class import tile Go to the \"Modding\" tab and then \"Workshop Upload\" Fill in the details for your mod, including the name, and thumbnail image Click \"Upload\" This will give you a big long number, which is the ID of your mod. You can use this to share your mod with others. The link to your mod will just be https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id= followed by the ID of your mod. If you’re not using the site to create your class, and instead just want to use it to import your class into TTS, you can still do this. Rather than using the \"Upload Image\" buttons, you’ll need to manually link to the images of your assets. Ensure that the level 1/X cards are separate from the level 2-9 cards, and that you’ve inputted the correct number of rows and columns for each card spread. Once this is done, there is one extra step needed, that normally would be done for you. This is naming all the cards for import into TTS. Next to each image of the card spread, you’ll see a large input box. This is where you need to input the name of the card. This should be the name of the card, followed by the initiative value in brackets, and then the level of the card, in square brackets. For example, \"Mighty Attack (48) [1]\". This should just be in a list, with each card on a new line, similar to the perk list. Other than having to manually link all the images, and name all the cards, the process is the same as if you were using the site to create your class. And that’s it! You’ve now created a class, and imported it into Tabletop Simulator. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the Discord, and someone will be able to help you out. Have fun playing your new class!","title":"Card Creator Documentation","component":"creator","version":"","name":"card_creator","url":"/creator/card_creator.html","titles":[{"text":"Navigation","hash":"nav-menu","id":1},{"text":"Introduction","hash":"introduction","id":2},{"text":"Getting Started","hash":"getting-started","id":3},{"text":"Base Info","hash":"base-info","id":4},{"text":"Creating a Deck","hash":"creating-a-deck","id":5},{"text":"Deck Building","hash":"deck-building","id":6},{"text":"Show Properties","hash":"show-properties","id":7},{"text":"Show Color Properties","hash":"show-color-properties","id":8},{"text":"Change Base Card","hash":"change-base-card","id":9},{"text":"Elements","hash":"deck-elements","id":10},{"text":"Adding Cards","hash":"adding-cards","id":11},{"text":"Syntax","hash":"syntax","id":12},{"text":"Tab Hierarchy","hash":"tab-hierarchy","id":13},{"text":"Basic Actions","hash":"basic-actions","id":14},{"text":"Conditions","hash":"conditions","id":15},{"text":"Elements","hash":"elements","id":16},{"text":"Custom Actions","hash":"custom-actions","id":17},{"text":"Sub Blocks","hash":"sub-blocks","id":18},{"text":"Optional Blocks","hash":"optional-blocks","id":19},{"text":"Mandatory Blocks","hash":"mandatory-blocks","id":20},{"text":"Tokens","hash":"tokens","id":21},{"text":"Token Modifiers","hash":"token-modifiers","id":22},{"text":"Summons","hash":"summons","id":23},{"text":"Named Abilities","hash":"named-abilities","id":24},{"text":"Mode Blocks","hash":"mode-blocks","id":25},{"text":"Other Common Card Properties","hash":"other-common-card-properties","id":26},{"text":"Styles & Modifiers","hash":"styles","id":27},{"text":"Common Style Modifiers","hash":"common-style-modifiers","id":28},{"text":"More Style Modifiers","hash":"more-style-modifiers","id":29},{"text":"Position","hash":"position","id":30},{"text":"Advanced Styling","hash":"advanced-styling","id":31},{"text":"Tabletop Simulator Mod","hash":"tts-mod","id":32},{"text":"Assets","hash":"tts-assets","id":33},{"text":"Starting Deck","hash":"tts-assets-starting-deck","id":34},{"text":"Advanced Deck","hash":"tts-assets-advanced-deck","id":35},{"text":"The Rest of the Easy Stuff","hash":"tts-assets-easy-stuff","id":36},{"text":"Manually Linked Assets","hash":"tts-assets-manual","id":37},{"text":"Final Options","hash":"tts-assets-extra","id":38},{"text":"Importing","hash":"tts-import","id":39},{"text":"Third Party Card Spreads","hash":"third-party-card-spread","id":40},{"text":"Finish","hash":"finish","id":41}]},"57":{"id":57,"text":"This documentation will describe how to use, and the available features of the Custom Class Creator (CCC).

The following terms are used to describe specific directories inside the repository: Code directory The directory packages/code. Mod directory The directory mods/game/Frosthaven. Execute the command pnpm scenario (e.g. pnpm scenario 4) inside the packages/script directory of the repository. This will read the file FH_.lua (e.g. FH_004.lua) and convert it to the new scenario format. It will create a file fh-.ts (e.g. fh-4.ts) inside the src/game/frosthaven/scenario directory of the code directory. This file needs to be updated to change the scenario. The generated scenario definition is a TypeScript file. To make it usable inside TTS, it needs to be a Lua file. Run the command pnpm build inside the code directory to convert all TypeScript files to Lua files. Alternatively, you could execute the command pnpm dev inside the same directory and keep the command line open where this command was executed. This will start a watching process on all TypeScript files. Whenever a TypeScript file is saved, it’s automatically converted to the Lua file as long as this process is running. Otherwise, the pnpm build command needs to be executed each time. The above steps only create the scenario script itself, but not the token that holds that scenario. Open the file campaign.yaml inside the data directory of the mod directory. Add the index of the new scenario to the existing list. Example content of the campaign.yaml file kind: campaign name: Frosthaven scenarios: - \"1\" - \"2\" - \"3\" - \"4\" # New scenarios are added here, and should be sorted Be sure to surround the numbers with \". Then execute the pnpm embed command from the mod directory (or the pnpm embed:fh command from the root directory which also includes this command). This will generate the token that holds the scenario script and add it to the game box. Inside the mod directory, find the directory content/Frosthaven.frosthaven/AutoAssets.assets/Scenarios.scenarios. Open the Contents.json file inside this directory and remove the entry for the removed scenario. It can be identified by checking the scenario index. Before [ { \"path\": \"./FH-000.9911c9\" }, { \"path\": \"./FH-004.831416\" }, { \"path\": \"./FH-005.5f8908\" } ] After [ { \"path\": \"./FH-000.9911c9\" }, { \"path\": \"./FH-005.5f8908\" } ] Also, delete the directory of the same name inside that directory. Embedding again will remove the old scenario from the game box. First, load FHE as usual and start a new campaign. Then, spawn the new scenario. This is easiest by entering >spawn-scenario fh- (e.g. >spawn-scenario fh-4) into the chat window. Now save the game and load it again. If everything already works as intended and is correctly placed, that’s great. If not, make adjustments to the scenario definition. In order to not do the whole embedding and loading process all the time, it’s easier to use VS Code with the TTS Editor extension (as mentioned here). First, make sure the pnpm dev command is running somewhere (as mentioned above). This makes sure that any changes to the scenario definition are directly converted to Lua. Then use the VS Code command palette (CTRL+SHIFT+P by default). Search for the command \"Update Object\" Selecting this command will open another popup where you can select an object currently on the table of the loaded TTS save. Search for the scenario token (which always has the name fh-). Select that again and now the object will be updated in the background with the current script. Now simply spawn the scenario again to get the latest scenario definition. Again, use the chat window to make this faster as this also includes clearing the current map. Use the Arrow Up key to easily get to the last entered chat message again instead of typing it again.","title":"Upgrading Scenarios","component":"dev","version":"","name":"scenarioUpgrade","url":"/dev/scenarioUpgrade.html","titles":[{"text":"Convert the old scenario definition","hash":"_convert_the_old_scenario_definition","id":1},{"text":"Convert the scenario definition to a .lua file","hash":"convert","id":2},{"text":"Add the scenario to the Frosthaven game box","hash":"_add_the_scenario_to_the_frosthaven_game_box","id":3},{"text":"Remove the old scenario","hash":"_remove_the_old_scenario","id":4},{"text":"Testing and changing the scenario","hash":"_testing_and_changing_the_scenario","id":5}]},"64":{"id":64,"text":"The following tools need to be present on your system to effectively work with the mod and its tools. git To synchronize changes on the local file system with the one on GitHub. By default, this comes with a command line tool and a bare-bones UI. It’s recommended to also install other tools that offer better UIs to effectively work with git, like GitHub Desktop or the integration in editors like Visual Studio Code node.js An engine to execute JavaScript/TypeScript code. Most tools surrounding the mod are written with TypeScript so this needs to be installed to execute them. pnpm A package manager for external libraries used by the tools. Also mainly used to actually start the different tools from a command line. Visual Studio Code A multipurpose text-editor/development tool. Makes it easier to read and write the mod’s code and work with the tools. Also has extensions that make it integrate into TTS directly, like this one. Inside the TTS save game directory create the following files: Enginehaven_Dev.json Frosthaven_Dev.json The content doesn’t matter, just their existence is important. After installing everything, clone the repository with git somewhere on your local filesystem. If you use the command line to clone, be sure to include the following flag: git clone --recurse-submodules Otherwise, run the following command after cloning the repository: git submodule update --init --recursive Then run the command pnpm install via a command line. This will install the external dependencies required for the tools in the repository. It will also probably show some warnings which will be fixed automatically later on. Then, run the command pnpm build via a command line. This will build the tools on your local file system so they are ready to use. Finally, run the command pnpm install again. Whenever you perform a git pull to get the latest changes from GitHub, a pnpm install will typically be automatically executed if it is required. It’s also recommended to execute the pnpm build command again and then to build any updates to the tools. This is not done automatically. To create the latest save games of the mod based on the current state of the repository, run the command pnpm embed:fh. This will fill the previously created files Enginehaven_Dev.json and Frosthaven_Dev.json with actual TTS save files. Load the save Enginehaven_Dev inside TTS. Then additively load Frosthaven_Dev.
